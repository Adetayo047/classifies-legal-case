A Declaration that the Plaintiff is both the legal and equitable owner of all that large piece or parcel of land measuring 928.804 Sq. Meters registered as No. 4 at page 4 in Volume 157 in the Land Registry and situate at R. S. Okeaya Inneh Estate Layout at Isiohor near Bendel Development and Planning Authority Housing Estate, Ugbowo, Benin City.\\n2. A Declaration that the Plaintiff is entitled to possession and statutory right of occupancy of the said piece of land measuring 928.804 square Meters delineated in Survey plan No. ISO/BD/09/88 within the larger areas of land of K.S. OKEAYA INNEH'S Estate Layout at Isiohor, near Bendel Development and Planning Authority housing Estate, Ugbowo, Benin City.\\n3. An Order of possession in respect of the land in favor of the Plaintiff.\\n4. A Declaration that any purported claim by way of sales from any person by the defendants is null and void.\\n5. An Order of perpetual injunction restraining the Defendants either by themselves or their servants, and/or agents from dealing with the said land either by building or sales in a manner that is inconsistent with the legal rights&nbsp;and interests of the Plaintiff.\\n6. N5,000,000.00 as general damages for trespass into the land described in (a) above against the Defendants; and\\n7. Any other relief that may be proper in the interest of justice.&nbsp;\\n\\nThe gist of the case of the 1st Respondent as Claimant before the trial Court was that he bought and duly registered the land in dispute in 1972 from his predecessor in title, one Ibhafidon Aburimen, who had earlier got a grant of the said land from the Oba of Benin, whose approval was granted on 8/12/1970 and that he has since 1972 been in undisturbed possession and exercised several acts of ownership, including plotting out the land, conveying portions to several persons without let or hindrance before the unauthorized trespass into the land in dispute by the Appellants.\\n\\u200bOn the other hand, the gist of the case of the Appellants as 1st and 2nd Defendants before the trial Court&nbsp;was that they bought the land in dispute from their predecessor in title, one Ugiagbe Omoragbon, who had earlier got a grant of the said land from the Oba of Benin, whose approval was granted on 10/1/1970 and that they had to settle through the 2nd Respondent with one Miss Iraigonse Okeaya - Inneh, to whom it was alleged that the 1st Respondent had assigned the land in dispute to. They have since developed the land in dispute by building thereon and are in occupation of their house thereon.\\n\\u200bAt the Court below, the parties filed and exchanged their pleadings and the matter proceeded to hearing. At the close of their respective cases, learned counsel for&nbsp;the parties filed and adopted their final written addresses, as well as made oral submissions on the issue of the locus standi of the 1st Respondent to maintain the action against the Respondents.&nbsp;\\nOn 14/4/2011, the trial Court delivered its judgment in which the claims of the 1st Respondent as Claimant against the Appellants as Defendants were granted.&nbsp;\\nBeing dissatisfied with the decision of the trial Court, the Appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal.\\n\",\n          \"This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court of Katsina State holden at Funtua in Suit No. KTH/FT/135M/10, delivered on 14/2/2011 by Hon. Justice I.M. Bako.\\n\\nThe Respondent commenced an action at the Federal High Court Katsina, against Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye under the undefended list procedure claiming the sum of Twenty Two Million, Four Hundred and Sixty-Six Thousand, Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50K) being the balance of payment due to the Respondent for carrying out sub-contract work of stone pitching of water drainage in Funtua town of Katsina State for Stirling Civil Engineering Nigeria Ltd. Judgment was entered in favour of the Respondent and the Appellant being dissatisfied appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal in appeal No. CA/K/201/2008 allowed the appeal in a judgment delivered on 15th December, 2010, on the ground that the Federal High Court, Katsina, lacked jurisdiction to entertain the action; hence the judgment was set aside and the suit struck out. Consequently, the Respondent filed a fresh action before the High Court of Katsina State in Suit No: KTH/FT/135M/2010 under the undefended list procedure.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Respondent obtained the leave of Court to serve the originating processes on the Appellant outside jurisdiction and the bailiff of the trial Court served the writ of summons and accompanying affidavit with the order of the Court granting leave to serve outside jurisdiction (which was obtained ex parte) on the Appellant's secretary, one Miss Ebere Nge of Babington Ashaye &amp; Co. The bailiff of the trial Court filed a proof of service of the originating processes on the Appellant and also delivered the processes to the Appellant's Counsel at his chambers but no step was taken to file any notice of intention to defend the action. On 14th February, 2011, when the matter came up for hearing, the Appellant was absent and unrepresented by Counsel and no notice of intention to defend the action was filed by the Appellant. However, during the course of the proceedings, just when the Court was about pronouncing its judgment, counsel to the Appellant, Mr. O.A. Orewale Esq. arrived in Court very late and the judge refused to record the counsel's appearance. Upon a careful consideration of the Writ, the affidavit in support and Exhibits annexed and the oral submissions of Counsel to the Respondent, the High Court proceeded to enter judgment in favour of the Respondent for the sum of Twenty Two Million Four Hundred and Sixty Six Thousand Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50k) together with interest at the rate of 21% per annum until the entire judgment sum is paid. Sequel to the decision of the High Court, the Appellant as judgment debtor filed a motion dated 14th February, 2011, at the High Court praying the Court to set aside its judgment, which the Respondent's Counsel vehemently opposed in a counter affidavit among other issues that the Court had become functus officio and should dismiss the application. After a careful consideration, the High Court dismissed the application for lacking in merit. While the appeal was pending, the initial Appellant, Mr. Babington Ashaye died and the Appellant's Counsel filed an application dated 8th February, 2013, praying for leave to substitute Mr. Babington Ashaye with Mr. Babatunde Ajayi, who is the new Receiver of Stirling Civil Engineering Ltd. The application was granted by this Honourable Court on the 18th of June, 2013, and the notice of appeal was amended and filed accordingly.\\n\\n\\n\\nDissatisfied with the said judgment, the Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.\",\n          \"This appeal is against the judgment of the Federal High Court sitting in Warri in Suit No. FHC/WR/CS/53/2015 delivered on 5th April 2016, coram Hon.

The appellant claimed to have won the primary election at the end of poll and his name was forwarded to the Independent National Electoral Commission (1st Respondent) as the candidate of the 2nd respondent (PDP). According to him, his name was substituted with that of Mr. Reuben Izeze, the 3rd respondent. Efforts to get his name restored on the list of contestants who won the primary election of 2nd Respondent (PDP) met a brick wall and hence his suit against the Respondent at the Federal High Court.\\n\\nThe Appellant who was the plaintiff before the Federal High Court filed an originating summons on 9th April, 2015 wherein he claimed against all the Respondents who were defendants before the Federal High Court as follows:\\n\\\"(1) Whether the National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is empowered to conduct primaries and present candidates to the Delta State House of Assembly election scheduled for April 11, 2015 on behalf of the party.\\n(2) Whether the plaintiff having won and was issued the certificate of return as the winner of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) House of Assembly, Ughelli South Constituency primary election conducted by the National Working Committee of the 2nd defendant can be surreptitiously substituted with the 3rd defendant by the 1st and 2nd defendants as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly, Ughelli South Constituency elections in total disregard of the report of the 2nd defendant's electoral panel and electoral appeal committee for the conduct of the Delta State House of Assembly primaries held on the 29th day of November, 2014, the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).\\\"\\n\\nHe sought for the following reliefs consequent upon the determination of the foregoing questions.\\n\\\"(1) A declaration that the plaintiff having won the received (sic) the certificate of result as the winner of the Ughelli South Constituency, Delta State House of Assembly primaries conducted by the National Working Committee of the 2nd defendant, is the rightful and lawful candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly election slated for the 11th day of April 2015.\\n(2) A declaration that the 1st and 2nd defendants' surreptitious substitution of the plaintiff's name with the 3rd defendant's name as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly Ughelli South Constituency election slated for the 11th day of April 2015 in total disregard of the result of the primaries, report of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) electoral panel is contrary to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) and therefore unlawful, illegal and of no effect whatsoever.\\n(3) A declaration that any step taken by the defendant in furtherance of the unlawful substitution of the plaintiff with the 3rd defendant is disregard (sic) of the result of the primaries conducted by the National Working Committee of the PDP, report of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Electoral Panel, the People Democratic Party Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) is a nullity.\\n(4) An order reinstating the name of the plaintiff as the lawful and rightful candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly, Ughelli South Constituency election slated for the 11th day of April, 2015.\\n(5) An order nullifying the election of the 3rd defendant into the Delta State of Assembly, Ughelli South constituency held on the 11th day of April, 2015.\\n(6) An order nullifying and or setting aside the certificate of return issued by the 1st defendant to the 3rd defendant on the basis of the election held on 11th April 2015 on the ground that the said election amount to a nullity.\\n(7) An order directing the 1st defendant to issue a certificate of return to the plaintiff as the duly elected member of the Delta State House of Assembly representing Ughelli South constituency.\\n(8) An order directing the 3rd defendant to refund all monies, salaries, allowances and or benefits collected and received by him as a member representing Ughelli South constituency in the Delta State House of Assembly from the date (sic) swearing in until judgment is delivered.\\n(9) GENERAL DAMAGES\\nGeneral damages against the defendants jointly and severally in the sum of N500,000,000.00 (five hundred million naira).\\\"\\nRespective counsel after entering conditional appearance on behalf of their client (i.e. 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants) and joining issues with the Appellant also filed separate motions challenging the competence of the action by the Appellant and the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain the suit. Issues were also joined by the Appellant on the 2nd and 3rd Defendants/Respondents notice of preliminary objections. After the adoption of written addresses on the preliminary objection and processes of respective party in the substantive originating summons, the Federal High Court on the 5th day of April 2016 delivered its considered judgment wherein it upheld the preliminary objections by the 2nd and 3rd respondents and struck out the suit of the appellant.&nbsp;Dissatisfied with the said judgment, the Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

See pages 1 - 14 of the Record of Appeal. \\n\\nBRIEF STATEMENT OF FACTS\\nOn the one hand, the gist of the case of the 1st Respondent as Claimant before the Court below as can be gleaned from the averments in his pleadings and evidence, both oral and documentary as in the Record of Appeal, was that he bought and duly registered the land in dispute in 1972 from his predecessor in title, one Ibhafidon Aburimen, who had earlier got a grant of the said land from the Oba of Benin, whose approval was granted on 8/12/1970 and that he has since 1972 been in undisturbed possession and exercised several acts of ownership, including plotting out the land, conveying portions to several persons without let or hindrance before the unauthorized trespass into the land in dispute by the Appellants. \\n\\n\\u200bOn the other hand, the gist of the case of the Appellants as 1st and 2nd Defendants before the Court below, as can be gleaned from the averments in their\\n\\n4\\n pleadings and evidence both oral and documentary as in the Record of Appeal, was that they bought the land in dispute from their predecessor in title, one Ugiagbe Omoragbon, who had earlier got a grant of the said land from the Oba of Benin, whose approval was granted on 10/1/1970 and that they had to settle through the 2nd Respondent with one Miss Iraigonse Okeaya - Inneh, to whom it was alleged that the 1st Respondent had assigned the land in dispute to. They have since developed the land in dispute by building thereon and are in occupation of their house thereon. \\n\\n\\u200bAt the Court below, the parties filed and exchanged their pleadings and the matter proceeded to hearing. In proof of his claims, the 1st Respondent as Claimant testified and called one witness and tendered several documents, which were admitted in evidence, as Exhibits and closed his case. In their defense, the Appellants as Defendants testified through the 2nd Appellant and called two witnesses and tendered some documents, which were admitted in evidence, as Exhibits and closed their case. The 2nd respondent testified for himself. At the close of their respective cases, learned counsel for\\n\\n5\\n the parties filed and adopted their final written addresses on 25/1/2010, as well as made oral submissions on the issue of the locus standi of the 1st Respondent to maintain the action against the Respondents. On 14/4/2011, the Court below delivered its judgment in which the claims of the 1st Respondent as Claimant against the Appellants as Defendants were granted. See pages 111 - 189 and 190 - 194 of the Record of Appeal. \\n\\nISSUES FOR DETERMINATION\\nIn the Appellants\\u2019 amended brief, four live issues were distilled as arising for determination from the surviving five amended grounds of appeal, namely; \\n1. Whether the Court below was right when it held that the 1st Respondent had proved his title to the land in dispute? (Distilled from Grounds 5 and 11)\\n2. Whether the 1st Respondent had proved that the land in dispute over which the Court below granted him a declaration of title actually measured 928.067 square meters? (Distilled from Ground 6)\\n3. Whether the Court below was right when it held that the Appellants failed to join issues with the 1st Respondent on the averments raised in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Statement of Claim and\\n\\n6\\n as a result held that the Appellants must be deemed to have admitted those averments? (Distilled from Ground 7)\\n4. Whether the Court below was right when it held that the issue of locus standi of the 1st Respondent to initiate the Suit was strange and cannot be accommodated by the Court at the stage it was raised and consequently, failed to consider it and reach a decision on it? (Distilled from Grounds 8 and 9) \\n\\nIn the 1st Respondent\\u2019s brief four live issues were distilled as arising for determination in this appeal, namely: \\n1. Whether the Court below was not right when it held that the 1st Respondent has proved his title to the land in dispute on the preponderance of evidence as required by law? (Distilled from Ground 5)\\n2. Whether the Court below was not right when it granted the 1st Respondent\\u2019s reliefs as per paragraph 17(1) and (2) of his 2nd Further Amended Statement of Claim? (Distilled from Ground 6)\\n3. Whether the Court below was not right when it held that the Appellants did not properly join issues with the 1st Respondent with respect to his averments contained in paragraphs 11 and 12 of 1st Respondent\\u2019s\\n\\n7\\n 2nd Further Amended Statement of Claim and that no evidence was led to contradict the averments? (Distilled from Ground 7)\\n4. Whether the 1st Respondent does not possess the locus standi to institute and maintain the Suit No. B/413/2000 leading to the instant appeal? (Distilled from Grounds 8 and 9)\\n\\nMy lords, at the hearing of this appeal on 30/6/2021, learned counsel for the Appellants withdrew Grounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 10 and 11 of the Amended Notice and Grounds of Appeal from which no issues for determination were formulated as well as his issue five for determination. In law, these grounds of appeal and issue for determination having been withdrawn are hereby deemed abandoned and consequently struck out. See&nbsp;West African Offshore Ltd V Ariri (2015) 18 NWLR (Pt. 1490) 177 @ pp. 193 - 194. \\n\\n\\u200bI have taken time to consider averments of the parties as well as the issues joined in their pleadings and the evidence, oral and documentary led by them as in the Record of Appeal. I have also considered the submissions of counsel to the parties in their respective briefs in the light of the findings and decisions reached in the judgment of the Court below. Upon\\n\\n8\\n an anxious consideration of all the above, I am of the view that the four issues as distilled in the Appellants\\u2019 amended brief represent the apt issues for determination in this appeal, a consideration of which would, in my view, invariably involve a consideration of the four issues distilled in the 1st Respondent\\u2019s brief. However, I shall first consider Appellants\\u2019 issue three along with 1st Respondent\\u2019s issue three. Thereafter, I shall consider Appellants\\u2019 issue four along with 1st Respondent\\u2019s issue four. Then, I shall consider Appellants\\u2019 issues one and two together with 1st Respondent\\u2019s issues one and two and resolve all these issues in one fell swoop. \\n\\nISSUE THREE\\nWhether the Court below was right when it held that the Appellants failed to join issues with the 1st Respondent on the averments raised in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Statement of Claim and as a result held that the Appellants must be deemed to have admitted those averments? \\n\\nAPPELLANTS\\u2019 COUNSEL SUBMISSIONS\\nOn issue three learned counsel for the Appellants had submitted that the Court below was in grave error when it\\n\\n9\\n held that the Appellants did not deny the averments of the 1st Respondent in paragraphs 11 and 12 of his 2nd Amended Statement of Claim to the effect that he had at different times assigned Plot 34 to two persons, namely; Mr. Adaze Wilson Imafidon and Miss Iriagbonse Durojayi Okeaya-Inneh in error and that he had written a letter to Mr. Adaze Imafidon that he would allocate another parcel of land to him in replacement, a fact of which apart from Exhibits H and J, the 1st Respondent did not even lead any credible evidence in proof of thereof, and in law is deemed to have been abandoned and going to no issue, and contended that the Appellants directly and effectively denied these averments and maintained that they did not buy the land in dispute, Plot 35 from Mr. Adaze Imafidon but from one Miss Okeaya-Inneh through the 2nd Respondent and urged the Court to set aside the perverse finding that the Appellants were deemed to have admitted the averments in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s 2nd Amended Statement of Claim and to allow the appeal and dismiss the claims of the 1st Respondent for lacking in merit. \\n\\n\\u200bIt was also submitted that it was\\n\\n10\\n common ground between the parties that the land in dispute was Plot 35 and not Plot 34 in the 1st Respondent\\u2019s layout and contended that in the circumstances of the pleadings and the issues as joined by the parties it is clear that any matter or facts related to an alleged error in the allotment of Plot 34, a fact clearly within the personal knowledge of the 1st Respondent, of which the Appellants are not even in position to deny, to any person was never an issue, as no such issue was joined by the parties in their pleadings, which ought to have been considered holistically, in the case as presented and defended by the parties before the Court below and urged the Court to hold that the Appellants having responded to and denied the material averments in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s 2nd Amended Statement of Claim, the Court below was wrong to hold that the Appellants failed to deny those averments and were thus deemed to have admitted them and to set aside such irrelevant and perverse findings and allow the appeal and dismiss the claims of the 1st Respondent for lacking in merit. Counsel relied on Aja V. Okoro (1991) 7 NWLR (Pt. 203)&nbsp;260 @ p. 282.\\n\\n\\n11\\n1ST RESPONDENT\\u2019S COUNSEL SUBMISSIONS\\nOn his issue three, learned counsel for the 1st Respondent had submitted that Ground 7 of the Notice of Appeal and issue No. 3 emanating therefrom do not have any utilitarian value to the appeal of the Appellants in that Exhibit H does not relate to the land in dispute but rather relates to the land in dispute in a different land, Plot 34 and to a different case in Suit No. B/414/2000: Kola S. Okeaya-Inneh v Dr. Daniel Amu &amp; Anor and contended that the statement of the Court below on the issue of locus standi now being challenged in this appeal was of no moment in the determination of this appeal as it relates to a different Plot of land, Plot 34 and not to Plot 35 that is the land in dispute in this appeal and urged the Court to hold that issue three is merely academic since in law it is the ratio of a decision that a party is entitled to appeal against and not every statement or pronouncement made by the Court below and to dismiss the appeal for lacking in merit. Counsel relied on Peterside V. Wabara (2011) 6 NWLR (Pt. 1243) 328 @ pp. 337 - 338; Onafowokan V. Wema Bank Plc (2011) 12 NWLR\\n\\n12\\n (Pt. 1260) 24 @ p. 39; Daniel V.

Dairo (2015) 6 NWLR (Pt. 1454) 141 @ pp. 181 - 182. \\n\\nRESOLUTION OF ISSUE THREE\\nMy lords, it has been contended for the 1st Respondent that issue three for determination is merely academic and therefore, not worthy of any consideration and determination by this Court in this appeal in that it relates to matter which were not part of the facts on which issues were joined by the parties in this case before the Court below and thus, its determination one way or the other would be of no effect on the outcome of this appeal.\\n\\nNow issue three for determination in this appeal was stated to have been distilled from Ground 7 of the Amended Notice and Grounds of Appeal challenging the following pronouncement of the Court below in its judgment, namely: \\n\\u201cFurthermore, there are pleadings in the Plaintiff\\u2019s Statement of Claim that the said letters Exhibits H and H1 were written to the 1st and 2nd Defendants in respect of Plot 34 which had inadvertently been&nbsp;earlier assigned to Mr. Adaze Wilson and\\n\\n13\\n Iriagbonse Okeaya-Inneh and not Plot 35 which is the subject matter of the present suit. The Defendant did not properly join issues on the Plaintiff\\u2019s assertion in his pleadings on this issue and no evidence was lead to contradict the averments of the Plaintiff in the substance of the pleadings. It is therefore presumed that the Plaintiff averments in the said paragraphs 11 and 12 of his 2nd Amended Statement of Claim were admitted by the 1st and 2nd Defendants and thus established as what is admitted need no&nbsp;further proof.\\u201d See pages 185 - 186 of the Record of Appeal \\n\\nLooking at the pronouncement of the Court below on the averments of the parties and evidence led or not led in relation to Exhibit H, it would appear, and I so hold, that not only did the Court below found against the Appellants that they had admitted these averments of the 1st Respondent but it also based some of its crucial findings of fact as regards whether Exhibit H relates to the land in dispute, Plot 35 or to another land, Plot 34 and whether or not the error occasioned by Exhibit H was subsequently corrected by the 1st Respondent. These are some of the crucial findings\\n\\n14\\n that led ultimately to the decision of the Court below awarding title to the 1st Respondent against the Appellant in respect of Plot 35, which is the land in dispute in the case before the Court below and holding that the Appellants did not discredit or controvert the averments in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s 2nd Amended Statement of Claim relating to Exhibit H. \\n\\n\\u200bIn the light of the above, is issue three for determination in this appeal dealing with whether Exhibit H relates to Plot 34 or Plot 35 merely academic and therefore, not deserving of any consideration and determination in this appeal in that is not an appeal against any ratio in the decision of the Court below? I think not! So, would a determination of issue three for determination in this appeal as to whether or not the Appellants admitted Exhibit H relates to Plot 34, a land not in dispute in this case, and not to Plot 35, the land in dispute in this case, in any way affect crucially the decision of this Court in this appeal one way or the other? I think so! The reason for this is not farfetched, and it is simply that if Exhibit H is found to relate to Plot 35 then it\\n\\n15\\n would have a crucial effect on the determination of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s locus standi to institute and maintain the Suit against the Appellants before the Court below. However, if it is found not to relate to Plot 35 but relates to Plot 34, then of course it would be of no moment to this appeal since a determination of such as issue in relation to Plot 34 would have no effect whatsoever on the outcome of this appeal and would thus amount to a mere academic issue, which this Court would have no business concerning itself with in this appeal. \\n\\nIn law, an issue is said to be academic once it is no longer of any utilitarian value to the determination of the appeal one way or the other. In other words, its determination is not necessary for the effective determination of the live issues in an appeal. Indeed, Courts of law are loath to considering and resolving merely academic questions in their judgments since such determination would not serve any useful purpose.

Mimiko (No. 1) (2014) 1 NWLR (Pt. 1388) 225 @ pp. 254 - 255.\\n\\nIt follows therefore and I so hold, that the contention by the 1st Respondent that issue three for determination is merely academic is not well founded and it is hereby accordingly&nbsp;discountenanced. Having held that issue three for determination is not academic but one worthy of due consideration and resolution in this appeal, I shall proceed to consider and resolve it anon.\\n\\n\\u200bI have taken time to review the averments of the 1st Respondent in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the 2nd Amended Statement of Claim. I have also reviewed the averments of the Appellants in paragraph 14 of their Joint Amended Statement of Defense. I have also taken time to holistically review the entirety of the averments in the pleadings of the parties as in the Record of Appeal. I find the pronouncement of the Court below that the Appellants did not deny the averments of the 1st Respondent in paragraphs 11 and 12 of his 2nd Amended Statement of Claim, to the effect that he had at different times assigned Plot 34 to two persons, namely; Mr. Adaze Wilson\\n17\\n Imafidon and Miss Iriagbonse Durojayi Okeaya-Inneh in error and that he wrote a letter to Mr. Adaze Imafidon that he would allocate another parcel of land to him in replacement, a fact of which apart from Exhibits H and J, the 1st Respondent did not even lead any credible evidence in proof of thereof, and in law is deemed to have been abandoned and going to no issue, as erroneous on both the facts and in law. \\n\\n\\u200bNow, not only did the Appellants directly and effectively denied these averments and maintained that they did not re - purchase the land in dispute, Plot 35 from Mr. Adaze Imafidon but from one Miss Okeaya-Inneh through the 2nd Respondent, but they also rightly stated that they were not in position to admit or deny facts which were completely within the personal knowledge of the 1st Respondent. It is true in law that a denial must be direct and positive with detail of particulars of denial to amount to effective traverse, yet one party is not under any duty to positively deny facts which are squarely within the personal knowledge of the other party. He may put the other party to strict proof of facts averred as within his own personal knowledge. See\\n\\n18\\n Aja V. Okoro (1991) 7 NWLR (Pt. 203) 260 @ p. 282,&nbsp;where the Supreme Court had per Akpata JSC., stated inter alia thus: \\n\\u201c...It will, in my view be encouraging a Defendant to be mendacious to insist that he must deny flatly the fact of something he knows nothing about.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u200bMy lords, it was common ground between the parties that the land in dispute was Plot 35 and not Plot 34. On the pleadings and evidence led, issues were clearly and seriously joined between the parties as to the ownership of Plot 35, the land in dispute as between the 1st Respondent and the Appellants and Exhibit H was relevant, pleaded, relied upon and tendered in evidence as relating to Plot 35 as evidence of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s actions as Solicitors to the persons named in Exhibit H and written to the Appellants regarding their alleged trespass to the lands, amongst others, Plot 35, the land in dispute alleged to belong to the 1st Respondent\\u2019s Clients. Thus, the fact that Exhibit H had also earlier been tendered in evidence in another Suit No. B/414/2000 between the same parties in respect of Plot 34 rather lends credence to the fact that Exhibit H was written\\n\\n19\\n to the Appellants by the 1st Respondent in his capacity merely as Solicitor in respects of lands, not just one land, belonging to two of his Clients as was made even more clearer in Exhibit V, also written by the 1st Respondent to the Appellants\\u2019 Solicitors in response to Exhibit J. The contents of Exhibit H, as well as Exhibit V, speaks for itself and in law cannot be varied or contradicted by oral evidence of the 1st Respondent. \\n\\nIt is therefore&nbsp;clear to me that any matter or facts pleaded by the 1st Respondent to his alleged error in the allotment of Plot 34 not in dispute in this case to any person is a fact clearly within the personal knowledge of the 1st Respondent, of which the Appellants are not in a position to deny. Indeed such an issue was never an issue, as no such issue was joined by the parties in their pleadings. In my view, the Court below failed to consider the pleadings of the parties holistically as it is enjoined so to do by law to appreciate the totality of the respective cases of the parties as presented and defended by them. \\n\\nI find therefore, that the Appellants&nbsp;responded to and denied the material averments in\\n\\n20\\n paragraphs 11 and 12 of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s 2nd Amended Statement of Claim to the extent that they can possibly respond leaving out what was entirely within the personal knowledge of the 1st Respondent to prove same strictly by cogent and credible evidence at the trial before the Court below. It follows therefore and I so hold firmly, that the Court below was wrong when it held erroneously that the Appellants failed to deny the averments of the 1st Respondent in paragraph 11 and 12 of the 2nd Amended Statement of Claim, all of which material averments were in my finding effectively traversed leaving out those facts within the personal knowledge of the 1st Respondent to be proved strictly by him. Indeed it would amount to encouraging the Appellants to be mendacious to insist that they must deny flatly the fact of something they know nothing about and which was squarely within the personal knowledge of the 1st Respondent. See. Aja V. Okoro (1991) 7 NWLR (Pt. 203) 260 @ p. 282.\\n\\n\\u200bIn the light of all I have stated and held as above, issue three for determination is hereby resolved in favor of the Appellants against the 1st Respondent.\\n\\n21\\nISSUE FOUR\\nWhether the Court below was right when it held that the issue of locus standi of the 1st Respondent to initiate the Suit was strange and cannot be accommodated by the Court at the stage it was raised and consequently, failed to consider it and reach a decision on it? \\n\\nAPPELLANTS\\u2019 COUNSEL SUBMISSIONS \\nOn issue four, learned counsel for the Appellants had submitted that the 1st Respondent\\u2019s case was that he is the owner of the land in dispute, plot 35 situate in his Estate Layout and contended that by Exhibit H dated 10/11/1997, a letter written by the 1st Respondent to the Appellants, the 1st Respondent who described himself as the \\u2018original land owner\\u2019 stated categorically that he had disposed of his legal interest in the land in dispute to his Clients as named therein, namely; Adaze Wilson Imafidon and Iriagbonse Okeaya-Inneh and contended that on the face of the averments and evidence led by the 1st Respondent he lacked the locus standi to institute and maintain the action against the Appellants and urged the Court to hold that the Court below gravely erred when it failed to consider and resolve the jurisdictional issue of\\n\\n22\\n the competence of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s Suit, which in law can be raised at any stage of the proceedings and must be resolved first once raised, and to hold further that the 1st Respondent lacked the locus standi to institute the action against the Appellants and allow the appeal, set aside the perverse judgment of the Court below and strike out the 1st Respondent\\u2019s Suit for being incompetent.

Counsel relied on Adesanya V. President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1981) 5 SC 12; Amadi V. Essien (1994) 7 NWLR (Pt. 354) 91 @ p. 115; Ilori V.

Oduwaiye (2014) 6 NWLR (Pt. 1404) 427 @ p. 443. \\n\\nIt was also submitted that there was nothing in either the pleadings and/or the evidence of the Appellants, if that can even\\n\\n25\\n be looked at in law in considering the locus standi of the 1st Respondent, to support the weak and baseless contention of the Appellants that the 1st Respondent lacked the locus standi to institute the Suit and contended that in the circumstances, it was surprisingly for the Appellants to raise the issue of 1st Respondent\\u2019s locus standi in their final address before the Court below and urged the Court to hold that the Court below was right and on firm ground when it held that the procedure adopted by the Appellants was strange and amounted to a legal ambush and to dismiss the appeal for lacking in merit and affirm the judgment of the Court below. \\n\\nRESOLUTION OF ISSUE FOUR\\nMy lord, in law the term \\u2018locus standi\\u2019, though expressed in Latin, simply refers to the legal capacity of a party to institute proceedings in a Court of law. Thus, all that a Claimant need to do to establish his locus standi is to succinctly plead in his pleadings the entire or sufficient facts establishing his rights and obligations, including or showing all the key elements of locus standi, namely: violation of civil rights and obligations, sufficient interest\\n\\n26\\n in the matter and how the interest arose; justiciable enforceable action, all culminating into showing the existence of dispute between the parties. Once, these facts are evident or apparent in the pleadings of a Claimant the issue of locus standi is settled in favor of such a Claimant. In B.B. Apugo &amp; Sons Ltd V. Orthopaedic Hospitals Management Board (2016) 13 NWLR (Pt. 1529) 206 @ p. 269, the Supreme Court had reiterated inter alia thus: \\n\\\"A person has locus standi to sue in an action if he is able to show to the satisfaction of the Court that his civil rights and obligations have been or are in danger of being infringed\\u2026\\u2026To have locus standi the Plaintiff\\u2019s Statement of Claim must disclose sufficient legal interest, and show how such interest arose in the subject matter of the action\\u2026He has locus standi if he can show that he has a stake in the subject matter or outcome of the case, and must be able to establish that what he suffers or the injury to his person was the consequence of the Defendant\\u2019s act or conduct.\\\" \\nSee also Orogan V.

Olufosoye (1986) 1 NWLR (Pt. 18) 669. \\n\\nGenerally locus standi is an equitable plea and therefore, must be pleaded and raised in the pleadings of the defendant before it could be countenanced and determined either in limine as a preliminary issue or along with the substantive trial. However, over the years the issue of locus standi has been elevated to a threshold issue of jurisdiction, and therefore, can be raised at any stage of the proceedings and once raised, and being a jurisdictional issue, it is the law that it must be considered and determined by the Court before which it was raised one way or the other before the merit or otherwise of the substantive suit can be determined.

The 1st and 2nd Defendants deliberately and with utter disregard to the lawful title, possession, interest and right of the Plaintiff embarked on the development of the land with impunity.\\n16. The Plaintiff will contend at the trial that the deliberate acts of the 1st and 2nd Defendants in developing the land and now occupying the same is from the beginning unlawful, unwarranted and amounts to utter defiance of the Plaintiff\\u2019s lawful title, both in law, custom and equity to all intents and purposes.\\u201d See pages 5 - 6 of the Record of Appeal.\\n\\nMy lords, I have already found as fact whilst considering issue three for determination that Exhibit H was written by the 1st Respondent to the Appellants in relation to amongst others, the land in dispute in\\n\\n29\\n Plot 35. From the above averments, it is clear that the 1st Respondent had instituted the action against the Appellants before the Court below in his own right. At the trial several documents were tendered by the parties and admitted in evidence as Exhibits, out of which I find the following Exhibits are very instructive and relevant for the purposes of determining the issue dealing with the 1st Respondent\\u2019s locus standi. \\n\\nThere is Exhibit H which is same as Exhibit T. It is a letter dated 10/11/1997 and written by the Law Firm of the 1st Respondent and signed by one O. F. Asemokhai Esq., Solicitor, and addressed to the Appellants, stating inter alia thus: \\n\\u201cWe write to you as Solicitors to Mr. Adaze Imafidon\\u2026 and Miss Iriagbons Okeaya-Inneh\\u2026 referred to as our Clients. This letter is issued on our Clients\\u2019 full briefing and instruction. We have information that both of you have unlawfully encroached into our Clients\\u2019 land situate at&nbsp;Okeaya - Inneh Layout, Isiohor near Ugbowo Housing Estate Ugbowo, Benin City\\u2026 Be that as it may, we cannot stand by on our side and watch you taking advantage of our Clients not\\n\\n30\\n being in the Country to unlawfully and clandestinely take over their lands. This can never be as we are not known to ever compromise our Clients\\u2019 position in all material particular. Now therefore, take notice that our Clients have asked us to warn both of you on a final note to immediately vacate the above said land and to dismantle and remove any structure or structures you may have erected thereon.\\u201d\\n\\nThere is also Exhibit J, which is same as Exhibit U. It is a letter dated 26/11/1997 and written by the Law Firm of R. I. Ogbebor &amp; Co, Solicitors to the Appellants in response to Exhibit H, in which the land in dispute was described as belonging to Mr. Adaze Imafidon and Miss Iriagbonse Okeaya - Inneh and stating that the Appellants had some years before 1997, when Exhibit H was written to them already built and are in occupation of their house on the land in dispute. \\n\\n\\u200bThere is yet another document tendered as Exhibit V dated 21/6/1999, and titled \\u201cRe: Trespass to land at Ugbowo Benin City; 1. Land of Mr. Adaze Imafidon; 2. Land of Miss Iriagbonse Okeaya-Inneh\\u201d from the Law Firm of the 1st Respondent to the Solicitors to\\n\\n31\\n the Appellants and signed by the 1st Respondent, stating inter alia thus: \\n\\u201cThat I am the original owner of the respective parcel of land within a larger parcel of land over the years (about 15 hectares) out of it I subsequently assigned to the above mentioned Assignees\\u2026 As the last opportunity I shall be grateful to hear from you or respectfully see you and your Clients on or before the end of August 1999 to put an end to this dispute amicably as suggested earlier, failing which I shall be compelled in accordance with the instructions of the Assignees to resort to unpleasant Court action.\\u201d\\n\\nMy lord, it would appear that it was on the face of the above pleadings of the 1st Respondent and the documentary evidence led before the Court below that the Appellants had raised the issue of the locus standi of the 1st Respondent before the Court below and on 25/1/2010 it ordered the parties to address it orally, which they both did through their respective learned counsel. See pages 70- 93 of the Record of Appeal. \\n \\n\\u200bHowever, in its judgment delivered on 14/4/2011, the Court below had on the issue of locus standi stated and held inter\\n\\n32\\n alia thus: \\n\\u201c...The defense counsel raised by his address the issue of the locus standi of the Plaintiff to institute this action relying on Exhibits H, H1 and \\u201cJ\\u201d in these proceedings. My short answer to this issue raised by learned counsel is that it cannot be raised at this stage of the proceedings when all the evidence has been led and parties have closed their respective cases. It amounts to legal ambush and this honorable Court will not allow it. This is because the procedure adopted flagrantly and violently violates the Plaintiff\\u2019s fundamental human right to fair hearing as issues were not joined on it. Issues bordering on locus standi are usually raised by way of preliminary objections and the issue set down for hearing. After hearing arguments from both sides the Court can then validly rule on the issue. The procedure adopted by the learned counsel is therefore&nbsp;strange and cannot be accommodated by this honorable Court\\u201d. See page 185 of the Record of Appeal. \\n\\n\\u200bIt is the vehement contention of the Appellants that the 1st Respondent having by his own showing vide Exhibit H admitted to have disposed of and divested\\n\\n33\\n himself of any proprietary right in the land in dispute, Plot 35, in favor of his Client/Sister one Miss Erigbonse Okeaya-Inneh, no longer has any capacity or authority to institute an action in his own name and not as an attorney for and or on behalf of his Client/Sister, the alleged owner on his own admission and thereby rendered the entire action incompetent by reason of his lack of the requisite locus standi to maintain the action in his own name. \\n\\n\\u200bOn the other hand, it was also vehemently contended for the 1st Respondent that he remained the owner of the land in dispute, Plot 35, having not at any time disposed of and transferred ownership of same to his Clients, Mr. Adaze Imafidon and Miss Erigbonse Okeaya - Inneh in the absence of any document of transfer of his title to any of these person and that Exhibit H was in respect of Plot 34 having no bearing with Plot 35 the land in dispute in this appeal and that at any rate, Exhibit H is not a document transferring the 1st Respondent\\u2019s interest in the land in dispute to any of these two persons as erroneously contended by the Appellants and that the 1st Respondent having therefore, never divested\\n\\n34\\n himself of his ownership to the land in dispute, possesses the requisite locus standi to institute and maintain the action against the Appellants. \\n\\nMy lords, in cases in which the contentions of parties on an issue are divergent both by their pleadings and evidence led thereon, but there are documentary evidence tendered by them, it is the law, that since parties are bound by the documents tendered by them in evidence and are thus obliged to either swim or sink with the contents of such documents tendered by them, such documentary evidence can be used as hangers on which to assess the veracity of the oral evidence led by the parties. In law documents are the barometer with which the truth of oral evidence can be safely measured. See Kimdey V. Military Governor, Gongola State (1988) 2 NWLR (Pt. 77) 445. See also Fashanu V. Adekoya (1974) 6 SC. 83; UBA Plc. V. Jargaba (2002) 2 NWLR (Pt. 750) 200; Dawodu Vs Majolagbe (2001) 3 NWLR (PT. 703) 234. \\n\\n\\u200bHaving taken time to review the pleadings of the 1st Respondent, particularly paragraphs 13, 15 and 16 of the 2nd Further Amended Statement of Claim of the 1st Respondent and having considered the contents of\\n\\n35\\n Exhibits H, T, J. U and V, as well as the submissions of learned counsel for the parties, in the light of the decision of the Court below on the issue of the locus standi of the 1st Respondent, on the face of the above very direct and categorical statements of the 1st Respondent, to the effect that he has long divested himself of any proprietary right in the land in dispute in favor of his Clients, Mr. Adaze Imafidon and Miss Erigbonse Okeaya-Inneh and on whose behalf he was in correspondence with the Appellants as Solicitors in Exhibits H and V, and acting on their instruction and behalf, that I find the contention by the Appellants that the Court below was in grave error when it whimsically and without any legal validity refused, declined and/or neglected to consider and resolve the issue of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s locus standi to institute the action against the Appellants, merely on the untenable ground, as flimsy as it was, that an issue touching on the competence of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s suit, hence raising a threshold issue of jurisdiction, was raised too late in the proceedings to be accorded any determination. \\n\\n\\u200bIn my finding, the Court\\n\\n36\\n below was in grave error when it refused, failed and neglected to consider and determine the issue of locus standi of the 1st Respondent for which it called for oral addresses from learned counsel for the parties on the lame excuse that it was raised too late in the day. In law an issue of jurisdiction can never be raised too late in the day.&nbsp;It is always on time whenever it is raised since it is better that a Court decides on the competence of the matter before it first than proceeding to determine on the merit a matter lacking in competence, which would amount to nothing but an exercise in futility. In Osafile V. Odi (1990) 3 NWLR (Pt. 137) 130, the Supreme Court had pronounced with finality inter alia thus: \\n\\u201cA Court is bound to consider the case validly presented to it by parties before it. A refusal to do so on any pretext, except on a ground of law will amount to a denial of the right to hear such party, a ground fundamental to the administration of justice, the breach of which is fatal.\\u201d\\nSee also Bellview Airlines Limited V. Carter Harris (Proprietary) Limited (2016) LPELR - 40989 (CA), per Georgewill JCA;\\n\\n37\\nElephant Group Plc. V.&nbsp;National Security Adviser &amp; Anor (2018) LPELR - 45528 (CA), per Georgewill JCA. \\n\\nSo, can it be said that on the averments of the 1st Respondent himself in his 2nd Further Amended Statement of Claim and&nbsp;in light of the contents of Exhibits H, T, J, U and V, the 1st Respondent disclosed his locus standi to institute and maintain the action against the Appellants? I think not.&nbsp;In my finding taking all the averments in the 1st Respondent\\u2019s 2nd Further Amended Statement of Claim together along with Exhibits H, T, J, U and V, the 1st Respondent failed woefully to disclose any locus standi residing in him to institute and maintain the Suit No. No. B/413/2000: K. S. Okeaya - Inneh SAN V. Dr. Daniel Amu &amp;Ors., before the Court below. It follows therefore, and I so firmly hold, that Suit No. B/413/2000: K. S. Okeaya - Inneh SAN V. Dr. Daniel Amu &amp; Ors., is clearly incompetent and ought to have been struck out by the Court below.\\n\\n\\u200bI find the arguments by the 1st Respondent that Exhibit H does not amount to a document of transfer of title as bunkum, insincere and therefore, most unavailing to him. It was not the Appellants that said he had\\n\\n38\\n divested himself of his interest in the land in dispute, Plot 35 but it was him who had on his own volition and on his own showing said so not once but twice as in Exhibit H and in Exhibit V, where in response to Exhibit J, the reply from the Solicitors to the Appellants to his letter in Exhibit H, he had re - emphasized inter alia thus: \\n\\u201cThat I am the original owner of the respective parcel of land within a larger parcel of land over the years (about 15 hectares) out of it I subsequently assigned to the above mentioned Assignees\\u2026.to put an end to this dispute amicably as suggested earlier, failing which I shall be compelled in accordance with the instructions of the Assignees to resort to unpleasant Court action.\\u201d\\n\\nWhat else does the 1st Respondent want the Appellants to rely upon to raise the issue of his lack of locus standi to institute the action against them having told them by himself in Exhibits H and V that the land in dispute no longer belonged to him but belonged to his assignees, his Clients on whose instruction and behalf he wrote to the Appellants? Nothing else I can find! The 1st Respondent cannot be allowed to blow\\n\\n39\\n hot and cold as the same time and to approbate and reprobate on an issue he had so categorically conveyed to the Appellants in Exhibits H and V. The Appellants do not need any document of transfer of title to raise the issue of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s locus standi on the face of Exhibits H and V. See&nbsp;Ogunsakin V. Ajidara (2010) All FWLR (Pt. 507) 109 @ p. 129, where this Court per Denton-West JCA., had stated inter alia thus: \\n\\\"A party who has tendered a document in Court and admitted as an Exhibit cannot disassociate&nbsp;himself from a portion of the document and associate himself with the other portion. He cannot do so. Both law and equity will not allow him to do so. A party who has tendered a document in a Court of law and admitted as an Exhibit will at the end of the litigation either sail joyfully with it in the boat of victory or sink sorrowfully with it in the boat of defeat. He cannot be a beneficiary of both at the same time\\u201d\\nSee also Attorney General, Enugu State V. AVOP Plc. (1995) 6 NWLR (Pt. 399) 90. \\n\\u200bIn law, no party to an action before a Court of law has the liberty to be so inconsistent on the same issue and to so brazenly\\n\\n40\\n approbate and reprobate under any disguise of legal submissions. No wonder, documentary evidence, being earlier in time, more permanent and not so easily susceptible to manipulation, has come to stay to act as hangers on which to assess veracity of oral evidence. Indeed, consistency is the hallmark of honesty and truth. See&nbsp;Salawu Ajide V. Kadiri Kelani (1985) 2 NWLR (Pt. 12) 248. See also Governor of Lagos State &amp; Ors V. Ohaigo Nig. Ltd &amp; Anor (2018) LPELR - 45552 (CA) per Georgewill JCA.\\n\\nIn the light of all I have stated and held above, issue four for determination is hereby resolved in favor of the Appellants against the 1st Respondents and I hold firmly that Suit No. B/413/2000: K. S. Okeaya - Inneh SAN V. Dr. Daniel Amu &amp; Ors., is grossly incompetent. Thus, this appeal succeeds even on ground of issue four alone and the 1st Respondent\\u2019s Suit is therefore&nbsp;liable to be struck out. Consequently, Suit No. B/413/2000: K. S. Okeaya - Inneh SAN V. Dr. Daniel Amu &amp; Ors, is hereby struck out for being incompetent. \\n\\n\\u200bMy lords, having resolved issue four for determination in favor of the Appellants and holding firmly that the Court\\n\\n41\\n below erred in its refusal to consider the issue of locus standi after calling for and receiving oral addresses from learned counsel for the parties and further that the 1st Respondent having on his showing divested himself of his proprietary interest in the land in dispute, plot 35, thereby lacked the locus standi, the capacity to institute and maintain the action against the Appellants, and thereby finding the 1st Respondent\\u2019 Suit to be incompetent and thus liable to be struck out, there was really nothing further to consider in issues one and two for determination. These issues are no longer live issues but at best they have become merely academic. Courts of law are loath to considering and resolving merely academic questions in their judgments. In Charles Oke &amp; Anor V. Dr. Rahman Mimiko &amp; Ors (2013) All FWLR (Pt. 693) 1853, the full Court of the Supreme Court per Muhammad JSC, had this to say on this issue: \\n\\u201cIt is a principle of law long settled that the general attitude of the Courts of law is that they are loathe in making pronouncements on academic/hypothetical issues as it does not serve any useful purpose.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n42\\nSee&nbsp;also&nbsp;Uba Plc V.

Counsel relied on Enabulele V. Agbonlahor (1999) 4 NWLR (Pt. 598) 166; Aigbe V. Edokpolor (1977) 2 SC 1; Awoyegbe V. Ogbeide (1988) 1 NWLR (Pt. 73) 695. \\n\\n\\u200bIt was also submitted that the Court below was wrong when it held that the fact of registration of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s Vendor\\u2019s title to land conferred on him as the purchaser legal title to the land in dispute and a notice to the whole world that he is the legal owner of the land in dispute and contended that it was common ground between the parties that they both acquired title to the land in dispute under the Benin Native Law and Custom and therefore, the issue of registration of title to the land did not arise under the Benin Native Law and Custom and urged the Court to hold that the fact of the registration of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s predecessor\\u2019s defective title was of no moment since\\n\\n45\\n under the Benin Native Law and Custom priority and validity in land acquisition is determined by the date of the Oba\\u2019s approval and to allow the appeal, set aside the perverse judgment of the Court below and dismiss the 1st Respondent\\u2019s Suit for lacking in merit. Counsel referred to Sections 16, 17 and 18 of the Evidence Act 2011. \\n\\nOn issue two, learned counsel for the Appellants had submitted that the PW1, the Surveyor to the 1st Respondent admitted that in Exhibit G, part of the land in dispute, Plot 35 was outside the land of the 1st Respondent, a fact also confirmed by Exhibit O of the Appellants and the evidence of their Surveyor and contended that this piece of evidence was a serious contradiction and clearly inconsistent with the case of the 1st Respondent that he owns the entire land in dispute, Plot 35 and urged the Court to hold that the Court below fell into grave error when it held and found for the 1st Respondent that he had proved his title to the land in dispute measuring 928.067 Square meters contrary to the evidence of his own Surveyor since in law, evidence at variance with the pleadings goes to no issue as it proves nothing and\\n\\n46\\n to set aside this perverse finding, allow the appeal and dismiss the unproved claims of the 1st Respondent for lacking in merit. Counsel relied on&nbsp;Emegokwue V. Okadigbo (1973) 4 SC 78; Egbunike V. ACB Ltd (1995-1996) All NLR 126. \\n\\n\\u200bIt was also submitted that on the concurrence of the Surveyors to the parties in their evidence and in the light of Exhibits G and O, the Land in dispute Survey Plans of the parties, it was clear that the 1st Respondent failed to identity with any exactness the size and dimension of the land over which he was claiming a declaration of title to land which from the uncontroverted evidence of both Surveyors was certainly smaller than as claimed by the 1st Respondent and contended that in law a party\\u2019s Survey plan is a part and parcel of his pleadings and urged the Court to hold that Exhibit G tendered and relied upon by the 1st Respondent did not support his case as to the identity, size and dimension of the land over which he was claiming a declaration of title to land and to allow the appeal, set aside the perverse judgment of the Court below and dismiss the 1st Respondent\\u2019 claim of declaration of title to an\\n\\n47\\n indeterminate piece of land. \\n\\n1ST RESPONDENT\\u2019S COUNSEL SUBMISSIONS\\nOn his issue one, learned counsel for the 1st Respondent had submitted in law the duty of evaluation and assessment of evidence, as well as ascription of probative value thereto, are primarily within the domain of the trial Court and the Court of Appeal will not interfere with the findings of the trial Court when same was properly carried out by the trial Court and contended that the 1st Respondent in line with the requirements of the law on proof of title to land duly pleaded and proved his root of title to the land in dispute by showing through credible evidence that the land in dispute, Plot 35 is part of his larger piece of land he purchased from one Mr. Aburime Ibhafidon vide Exhibit B, a Deed of Transfer dated 26th June, 1972 and registered as No. 4 @ page 4 in Volume 157 of the Lands Registry, Benin City and that his Vendor, Mr. Aburime Ibhafidon acquired the said land from His Royal Highness, Oba Akenzua II, C.M.G. the Oba of Benin vide a Deed of Conveyance to which Oba\\u2019s approval is attached and registered as No. 4 @ page 4 in Volume 140 in the Lands Registry,\\n\\n48\\n Benin City as in Exhibits A and A1 and upon which he paid for the rubber trees on the land to the various owners vide Exhibits K, K1, K2 and K3 and thereafter started farming on the land until 1977 when the defunct Bendel State Government acquired the land and other adjoining parcels of land vide Exhibit C but on 5/1/1984 following the agitation of members of the Community led by the 1st Respondent, the Bendel State Government released the land earlier acquired back to their respective owners vide Exhibit D and urged the Court to hold that the Court below was correct when on a proper evaluation and ascription of probative value to all the evidence led by the parties it found rightly that it was the 1st Respondent that proved his title to the land in dispute as required of him by law and thus entitled to the judgment of the Court below and to dismiss the appeal for lacking in merit and affirm the sound judgment of the Court below.

Counsel relied on Amayo V. Erinmwingbovo (2006) 11 NWLR (Pt. 992) 669 @ p. 682. \\n\\nIt was further submitted that in law mere production of title document without more cannot establish title to land as against a person who has been in a very long undisturbed possession and has exercised several acts of ownership without any challenge from anyone and contended that since on the pleadings there was no dispute that the 1st Respondent is the bona fide owner of the entire 64 Plots of land covered by Exhibit E and forms one vast piece of land acquired by the 1st Respondent, had the Appellants been diligent enough to have conducted a search, they would have discovered the interest of the 1st Respondent, which is the only registered interest over the land as at 1992 when the Appellants purportedly purchased the land in dispute from one Pa Omoragbon Ugiagbe who had no title to the land in dispute and urged the Court to so hold and to dismiss the unmeritorious and misconceived appeal and affirm the judgment of the Court below.

Adewusi (2010) 15 NWLR (Pt. 1215) 78 @ p. 91.\\n\\n\\u200bOn his issue two, learned counsel\\n\\n51\\n for the 1st Respondent had submitted that the contention by the Appellants that there are discrepancies in the size and dimensions of the land as claimed by the 1st Respondent in his pleadings and as shown in Exhibit G, the Survey plan was misconceived in that it did not form part of the Appellants\\u2019 case before the Court below and was never made an issue by them and contended that the Court below also did not consider the said issue or make any pronouncement on it since it was not an issue before it and urged the Court to hold that in law a party is not allowed to make a case on appeal different from his case at the Court below and without first seeking and obtaining leave of Court to raise such fresh issue on appeal and to dismiss the appeal and affirm the judgment of the Court below. Counsel relied on&nbsp;Odom V. PDP (2015) 6 NWLR (Pt. 1456) 527 @ p. 569; Akingbola V. FRN (2015) 10 NWLR (Pt. 1468) 579 @ p. 626; C.G.G. (Nig.) Ltd. V.

Okeaya-Inneh v Dr. Daniel Amu &amp; Anor before the Court below and not to Plot 35, and urged the Court to hold that in law address of counsel, no matter how beautifully prepared, cannot be a substitute for credible evidence and to discountenance the Appellants\\u2019 misconceived submissions.

Elechi (2012) 13 NWLR (Pt. 1317) 330 @ p. 361.\\n\\nRESOLUTION OF ISSUES ONE AND TWO \\nMy lords, issues one and two frontally call into question the evaluation of evidence, findings and decisions of the Court below as to whether or not\\n\\n53\\nproper evaluations were carried out and findings flowing from such evaluation arrived at by the Court below and whether or not the decisions arrived at&nbsp;by the Court below were correct on the face of the state of the issues joined by the parties in the pleadings and the evidence led thereon.\\n\\nNow, while the Appellants had contended that the Court below did not carry out proper evaluation of the evidence and thereby arrived at wrong findings of facts leading to its perverse decision to grant the title to the land in dispute to the 1st Respondent, the 1st Respondent had contended that the Court below did a proper evaluation of the totality of the evidence led in line with the pleadings of the parties and did arrived at proper finding of facts and therefore, reached the correct decisions in granting his claims against the Appellants.\\n\\n\\u200bIn law, the duty of a trial Court to consider, appraise, review and evaluate all relevant and admitted evidence, whether oral or depositions and or documentary, placed before it before arriving at its findings and decision is a paramount, as well as a sacrosanct, one which cannot under any guise be abandoned or jettison\\n54\\n by a trial Court. Thus, where a trial Court fails in this duty then it fails it its entire duty of impartial adjudication between the contending parties before it and the appellate Court if so moved is under a bounden duty to intervene to evaluate the evidence as in the record and make relevant findings and reach appropriate decisions as borne out by the evidence in the interest of justice to the parties. See Olufosoye V. Olorunfemi (1989) 1 SC (Pt. 1) 29. See also Tangale Traditional Council V. Fawu (2001) 17 NWLR (Pt. 742) 330 @ pp. 335 - 336.\\n\\nIt is now elementary that evaluation of evidence would entail and demand that the evidence proffered by the parties are assessed, appraised and weighed impartially on the imaginary scale of justice by the Court so as to give probative value or quality to it and there must be on the record, and very importantly too, how the Court arrived at its choice of preference of one piece of evidence to the other. It cannot just be merely a product of the whims and caprices of the judge. No! He must show on record his reason for so doing. See Alake V. State (1992) 9 NWLR (Pt. 265) 260.

Ltd (2014) LPELR - 22583 (CA).\\n\\nThe 1st Respondent as Claimant before the Court below testified for himself and stated inter alia that he acquired his title from one Ibhafidon Aburimen vide a Deed of Conveyance executed on 26/6/1972, and that his own predecessor in title, Mr. Ibhafidon Aburimen acquired his title from His Royal Highness, Oba Akenzua II, the Oba of Benin by way of Conveyance into which an Oba's approval dated 8/12/1070 was attached and that both his predecessor\\u2019 title and his title were duly registered at the Land Registry, Benin. He also testified that he had been in undisturbed possession of the land in dispute and had over the years exercised several acts of ownership, including selling portion of his larger land to various purchasers without any let or hindrance. He tendered several documents which were admitted as Exhibits. He also called his Surveyor who testified as PW2.\\n\\n\\u200bOn their part, the 2nd Appellant testified on behalf of the Appellants and stated inter alia that they bought the land in dispute from their Predecessor in title, one Ugiabge\\n56\\n Omoragbon, who is a beneficiary of a grant of the land in dispute to him by the Oba of Benin and the Oba\\u2019s approval was dated 10/1/1970 based on an application made to the Oba of Benin on 15/12/1969. Upon their taking possession they met with some persons claiming to be purchasers of some of the portions of land purchased by them and had to enter into settlement with them and re - purchased the lands from them, including the land in dispute which in addition to their having validly bought same from their Vendor they had to re-purchase from the 2nd Respondent acting on behalf of his Sister one Miss Iriagbonse Okeaya - Inneh, to whom it was alleged that the 1st Respondent had assigned the land in dispute to but maintained that they had already validly purchased the land in dispute from their predecessor in title, Ugiagbe Omoragbon. They called two witnesses, one of which was their Surveyor. \\n\\nIt was on the strength of the pleadings and evidence of the parties led through themselves and their witnesses as in the Record of appeal, that the Court below had on 14/4/2011 delivered its judgment in which it granted the claims of the 1st Respondent against\\n\\n57\\n the Appellants, stating and holding inter alia thus: \\n\\u201c\\u2026\\u2026The Plaintiff's version of how he acquired title to the land is backed up by valid documents which were authentic and verifiable\\u2026right from the radical title of the Plaintiff's predecessor in title\\u2026Deed of Conveyance and the Oba's approval\\u2026.were duly registered at the Lands Registry, Benin City\\u2026.the Plaintiff\\u2019s Deed of conveyance dated 26/1972\\u2026was also registered at the Lands Registry, Benin City\\u2026.Thereby constituting a Notice to the whole world that the Plaintiff is indeed the legal owner of the piece or parcel of land part of which is now in dispute\\u2026The question then is, if indeed, Pa. Ugiagbe Omoragbon the Defendants' predecessor in title had already acquired title to the piece or parcel of land now in dispute as at 1970 when Exhibit A was signed\\u2026.he did not raise objection to the alleged subsequent conveyance of the same piece or parcel of land to Ibhafidon Aburimen by the Oba of Benin\\u2026? The only logical answer \\u2026is that there was no protest or objection from Pa. Ugiagbe because he did not own or have\\n\\n58\\n title to any piece of land in the area. The 1st and 2nd Defendants case on the other hand relies on an Oba's approval in the name of their predecessor in title\\u2026.and the Deed of transfer\\u2026The said Oba's approval\\u2026.is not registered at the Lands Registry\\u2026It is therefore my conclusion on this point that the Oba's approval and the Deed of transfer entered into by the 1st and 2nd Defendant coupled with the payment of the purchase price by the 1st and 2nd Defendants conferred only an equitable interest on them. Meanwhile, the Plaintiff's predecessor in title had earlier acquired legal title to the said piece of land by his Oba's approval and Conveyance dated in 1970\\u2026.The 1st and 2nd Defendants did not conduct any investigation of the title to the land before they proceeded to purchase same from Omoragbon Ugiagbe in 1992. For had they done so they would have discovered that the legal interest to the aforesaid piece or parcel of land had since been acquired by the Plaintiff and duly registered at the Lands Registry at Benin City\\u2026Thus, the 1st and 2nd Defendants cannot even claim the right of a bonafide purchaser for value without\\n\\n59\\n notice\\u2026.I therefore hold on this point that the Plaintiff has succeeded in proving good title to the land in dispute\\u2026. The 1st and 2nd Defendants bought nothing from the said Omoragbon Ugiagbe because at the time of the said transaction, the legal interest on the land in dispute was already vested in the Plaintiff\\u2026The transactions between the 1st and 2nd Defendants and the said Omoragbori Ugiagbe was therefore a nullity...\\u201d See pages 111 - 189 of the Record of Appeal. \\n\\nMy lords, it has been contended for the 1st Respondent that the issue of the exact size and dimension of the land in dispute as raised under issue two in this appeal is a fresh issue. What then is a fresh issue in law? In law, a fresh issue for which prior leave of Court is required to be valid is one which was not canvassed at the Court below and was therefore, not pronounced upon by the Court below. It is not one which though duly raised and issues joined and evidence led thereon but a trial Court fails or refuses or neglects to consider and determine it. Thus, it is not every issue which a trial Court did not pronounce upon that would automatically amount to a\\n\\n60\\n fresh issue. In law, once an issue was duly raised but was not considered and determined by the trial Court, it would not ipso facto amount to a fresh issue simply because the trial Court had failed to consider and resolve it. It is only where an issue was not raised before the trial Court but is being raised for the first time on appeal, without first seeking and obtaining the leave of Court, that such an issue would be considered invalid by this Court since this Court would then lack the jurisdiction to entertain any such fresh issue. To consider a fresh issue without leave would clearly be tantamount to ambushing the adverse party and which will undoubtedly contravene the inalienable right of the adverse party to fair hearing as guaranteed to him under Section 36(1) of the Constitution of Nigeria 1999 (as amended). See Donald V. Saleh (2015) 2 NWLR (Pt. 1444) 529 @ p. 566. See also Olalomi Ind. Ltd. v. N.I.D.B. Ltd. (2009) 16 NWLR (Pt. 1167) 266 @ p. 286. \\n\\nNow, there were copious joinder of issues and copious evidence led by the parties through their respective witnesses and Survey plans tendered before the Court below as to the size and dimension of\\n\\n61\\n the land being claimed by the 1st Respondent against the Appellants. So serious was this issue that both parties ferociously cross - examined the Surveyor to the other party and one evidence on which both Surveyors were concurrent and ad idem was that the part of the land being claimed by the 1st Respondent was clearly outside Plot 35 in Exhibit G as well as in the composite plan Exhibit O. So, how can it then be argued that the issue of the differences in the size and dimension of the land as claimed by the 1st Respondent and as shown in his own land in dispute litigation survey plan Exhibit G was not in issue? In my finding it was in issue and the Court below was under a duty to consider and resolve it but which it failed woefully to do as was even conceded to by the 1st Respondent. \\n\\n\\u200bIn law, the first duty on a party claiming declaration of title to land is to prove with exactitude the location, description, size, dimension and features of the land he claims both a declaration of title to land, damages for trespass, and perpetual injunction, and if he fails to discharge this duty, then his entire claim must fail. He is only relieved of this duty where the\\n\\n62\\n identity, size and dimension of the land in dispute which he claims is not put in issue by the adverse party. This is so because without the exact identity of the land in dispute over which a declaration of title is sought, there cannot be any declaration of title to an undetermined and indeterminate piece of land by the Court. The identity of the land in dispute is therefore&nbsp;sacrosanct and must be proved unless it is not put in issue. See&nbsp;Atanda V. Iliasu (2013) 18 WRN 1. See also Onwuka V. Ediala (1989) 1 NWLR (Pt. 96) 182. See also Makanjuola V. Balogun (1989) 3 NWLR (Pt. 108) 122; Echenim Ofume V. Isaac Ngbeke (1994) 4 NWLR (Pt. 341) 746; Olosunde V. Oladele (1991) 4 NWLR (Pt. 188) 113.\\n\\n\\u200bHaving resolved that issue two is not a fresh issue and therefore, no leave of Court was required, let me now consider issues one and two together and resolve them in one fell swoop. In addition to the oral evidence led the parties they also relied copiously on documentary evidence as in the Record of Appeal. I have taken time to review the pleadings of the parties and dispassionately evaluated the entirety of the evidence, both oral and documentary as led by the\\n\\n63\\n parties in the light of the findings and conclusion reached thereon by the Court below in holding that the 1st Respondent proved a better title to the land in dispute and was therefore&nbsp;entitled to the declaration of title to the land in dispute as against the Appellants. Let me now use the copious documentary Exhibits as hangers to access the veracity of the oral evidence as led by the parties and see whether or not the findings and conclusions reached by the Court below, and complained of in this appeal, do flow from the evidence as led by the parties and were thus correct, sound and unimpeachable in this appeal. \\n\\nIn Exhibit A, an indenture in which the 1st Respondent\\u2019s predecessor in title, one Ibhafidon Aburime, was granted by His Highness Oba Akenzua II the Oba of Benin some parcel of land on 3/2/1972, in the recital it is stated inter alia thus: \\n\\u201cWhereas... 2. By an application dated the 31/10/1970 the Grantee applied to the Grantor for a grant of the said piece or parcel of land; 3. The said application was granted on the 8/12/1970.\\u201d\\n\\nIn Exhibit B, an indenture in which the 1st Respondent\\u2019s predecessor in title\\n\\n64\\n conveyed some parcels of land to the 1st Respondent on 26/6/1972 in respect of the land earlier granted to the 1st Respondent\\u2019s predecessor by the Oba of Benin as in Exhibit A. In Exhibit F, the 1st Respondent plot layout showing Plots 32, 33, 34 and 35, which is the plot in dispute. In Exhibit G, the 1st Respondent\\u2019s amended Survey Plan of the land dispute, in which it is shown clearly that part of Plot 35 is outside the land of the 1st Respondent and was made by the 1st Respondent\\u2019s own Surveyor, one Surv. F. U. Iyawe and dated 28/3/2002. In Exhibit O, the Appellants\\u2019 Land in dispute Survey Plan, in which it is shown clearly that part of the land in dispute is outside the 1st Respondent\\u2019s land but including the 1st Respondent\\u2019s Plots 32, 33, 34 and part of Plot 35. It was made by the Appellants\\u2019 Surveyor, one Surv. Osaikhunwu and dated 2/7/2001. In Exhibit Q, the Appellants\\u2019 predecessor in title\\u2019s application for approval by Oba of Benin dated 15/12/1969 and which was approved by the Oba of Benin on 10/1/1970. In Exhibit R, the 1st Appellant\\u2019s Deed of Transfer dated 22/12/1977 from his Vendor together\\n\\n65\\n with the Oba approval granted on 10/1/1970.\\n\\nNow, going by Exhibits G and O, coupled with the admission under cross\\u2013examination by the respective Surveyors to the 1st Respondent and the Appellants it is clear and I so find as fact, contrary to the perverse finding by the Court below that the land in dispute is covered in its entirety by Plot 35, that some part of the land in dispute is clearly outside Plot 35 claimed by the 1st Respondent. It is clear on the pleadings that both parties relied on Oba\\u2019s approval and indenture from the Oba of Benin as the respective root of title of their predecessors in title to the land in dispute. \\n\\n\\u200bHowever, there is clear, unchallenged and uncontroverted evidence vide Exhibits A and R, that the root of title of the Appellants vide Oba\\u2019s approval in favor of their predecessor in title was made on 10/1/1970, while the root of title of the 1st Respondent vide Oba\\u2019s approval in favor of his predecessor in title was made on 8/12/1970. It follows therefore, and I so find as fact that the Oba\\u2019s approval of the Appellants\\u2019 predecessor in title, that is their root of title to the land in\\n\\n66\\n dispute, is prior to and therefore, predates the 1st Respondent\\u2019s predecessor\\u2019s Oba approval, that is his root of title. The parties are ad idem and the evidence on it are unchallenged that both Oba\\u2019s approval relates to the same land in dispute. \\n\\nThus, as at 3/2/1972 when Exhibit A was executed between His Highness Oba Akenzua II as Grantor and Ibhafidon Aburime as Grantee, the Vendor/predecessor in title to the 1st Respondent, based on the Oba\\u2019s approval made on 8/12/1970, on the face of the earlier Oba\\u2019s approval made on 10/1/1970 in favor of Ugiagbe Omoragbon, the Vendor to the Appellants, as in Exhibit Q, there was no proprietary interest or right left in the Oba of Benin in the land in dispute to grant or approve or convey to the Vendor to the 1st Respondent in the absence of any evidence of cancellation of the earlier Oba\\u2019s approval made on 10/1/1970 in favor of the Vendor/Predecessor in title to the Appellants. \\n\\n\\u200bIn law therefore, as at 26/6/1972 when the 1st Respondent purported to buy the land in dispute as part of the land conveyed to him by his Vendor one Ibhafidon Aburime, his Vendor had nothing to\\n\\n67\\n convey unto the 1st Respondent. The law is \\u2018nemo dat quod non habet\\u2019, meaning one cannot give out what one does not have. See Amuda V. Ajobo (1995) 7 NWLR (Pt. 406) 170 @ p. 182, where it was stated inter alia thus:\\n\\\"The position is that the Defendant sued by the Plaintiff had no interest in the land subject matter of the dispute. Having sold the land to architect Adedeji as pleaded by the Defendant and given in evidence by the 1st Defendant, the Defendant has no interest whatsoever in the land in dispute to protect or defend\\u2026Consequently, her counter claim fails in its entirety and is hereby dismissed.\\\"\\n\\nMy lords, the law is and has always been that mere production of title documents, such as Exhibits A and B alone by the 1st Respondent did not ground any valid title to the land in dispute in that&nbsp;such a document of title to ground title to land must be a valid document capable of passing title to the party relying on it.&nbsp;It is also the law that registration of title document alone does not ipso facto cure a defective root of title.It is agreed by both parties, and it had been judicially noticed and accepted as true that under\\n\\n68\\n the Native and Custom in relation to land as obtainable in the Benin Kingdom, at least before the promulgation of the Land Use Act in 1978, all lands are vested in the Oba of Benin, who is the overlord of all lands. Thus, a grant of land by the Oba of Benin based on the Oba\\u2019s approval of such a grant of land to a grantee was by itself valid and is neither subject to nor requires registration at the Lands Registry Benin City to be valid. See&nbsp;Amayo V. Erinmwingbovo (2006) 11 NWLR (Pt. 992) 669 @ p. 682, where the Supreme Court per Katsina - Alu, JSC (as he then was but later CJN) had stated inter alia thus: \\n\\u201cLand in Benin is vested in the Oba of Benin under Customary Law\\u201d. \\nSee also Atiti Gold V. Beatrice Osaseren (1970) 1 All NLR 125.\\nIt would appear that registration of title document strictu senso was unknown to the Benin Customary land tenure system before 1978. In other words, the validity of a grant made by the Oba of Benin based on the Oba\\u2019s approval is final and does not become invalid merely for lack of registration, at least before the coming into force of the Land Use Act 1978 as in the instant appeal involving\\n\\n69\\n grant by the Oba of Benin and Oba\\u2019s approval made in 1970, long before the promulgation of the Land Use Act in 1978. In the circumstances therefore, it is my view and I so hold, that the Court below clearly misapprehended and misdirected itself on the onus of proof and arrived at very perverse findings and conclusions in its judgment, even running contrary to the case as pleaded and presented before it by the 1st Respondent, whose witness PW1 affirmed that part of the land in dispute was clearly outside the land being claimed by the 1st Respondent as in Exhibit G, while the Court below, without any supporting evidence, found on the contrary that the entire land in dispute was within the land claimed by the 1st Respondent. \\n\\nI have considered the contention of the learned counsel for the 1st Respondent on the effect of the submission to settlement by the Appellants with the 2nd Respondent acting on behalf of Miss Eregbonse Okeaya-Inneh. There is an agreement dated 9/4/1993 and tendered in evidence as Exhibit S. It is titled \\u2018Re: Purchase of land agreement\\u2019 made between Mr. Ola Okeaya-Inneh standing on behalf of his Sister, Miss Erigbonse\\n\\n70\\n Okeaya-Inneh currently in the USA and Dr. and Mrs. O. D. Amu stating inter alia thus: \\n\\u201c\",\n          \"UWANI MUSA ABBA AJI, J.C.A.: (Delivering the Leading Judgment): This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court of Katsina State holden at Funtua in Suit No.KTH/FT/135M/10, delivered on 14/2/2011 by Hon. Justice I.M. Bako, wherein the claims of the Respondent against the Appellant for the sum of N22,466,200.50 under the undefended list were granted.\\n\\nThe Respondent's Claims at the lower Court against the Appellant under the \\\"Undefended List\\\" vide the Statement of Claim dated 20/12/2010 contained at pages 43-44 of the records were as follows:\\n1. The sum of N22.466.200,50 (Twenty Two Million, Four Hundred and sixty six Thousand, Two Hundred Naira, Fifty Kobo) being the balance payment due to the plaintiff for carrying out sub-contract work of stone-pitching of water drainage in Funtua town of Katsina State for Sterling Civil Engineering Company Limited.\\n2. Interest on the above sum at the rate of 21% per annum until the entire judgment sum is paid.\\n3. Cost of action.\\n\\nThe Respondent commenced an action at the Federal High Court Katsina, against Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye under the undefended list procedure\\n1\\nclaiming the sum of Twenty Two Million, Four Hundred and sixty Six Thousand, Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50K) being the balance of payment due to the Respondent for carrying out sub-contract work of stone pitching of water drainage in Funtua town of Katsina State for Stirling Civil Engineering Nigeria Ltd. Judgment was entered in favour of the Respondent and the Appellant being dissatisfied appealed to this Honourable Court. This Honourable Court in appeal No. CA/K/201/2008 allowed the appeal in a judgment delivered on 15th December, 2010, on the ground that the Federal High Court, Katsina, lacked jurisdiction to entertain the action; hence the judgment was set aside and the suit struck out. Consequently, the Respondent filed a fresh action before the High Court of Katsina State in Suit No: KTH/FT/135M/2010 against Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye (Receiver/Manager Stirling Civil Engineering Nig. Ltd.) under the undefended list procedure claiming Twenty Two Million Four Hundred and Sixty Six Thousand Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50K) being the balance payment due to the Plaintiff for carrying out sub-contract work of stone\\n2\\n pitching of water drainage in Funtua town of Katsina State for Stirling Civil Engineering Nigeria Ltd.\\n\\nThe Respondent applied at the trial Court for the matter to be placed on the Undefended List pursuant to Order 22 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules Cap 60 Laws of Katsina State, 1991 and being satisfied that the requirements of the Rules of Court had been met, the Court granted the application. Furthermore, the Respondent obtained the leave of Court to serve the originating processes on the Appellant outside jurisdiction and the bailiff of the trial Court served the writ of summons and accompanying affidavit with the order of the Court granting leave to serve outside jurisdiction (which was obtained ex parte) on the Appellant's secretary, one Miss Ebere Nge of Babington Ashaye &amp; Co. The bailiff of the trial Court filed a proof of service of the originating processes on the Appellant and also delivered the processes to the Appellant's Counsel at his chambers but no step was taken to file any notice of intention to defend the action. On 14th February, 2011, when the matter came up for hearing, the Appellant was absent and unrepresented by\\n\\n3\\n Counsel. No notice of intention to defend the action was filed by the Appellant. However, during the course of the proceedings, just when the Court was about pronouncing its judgment, counsel to the Appellant, Mr. O.A. Orewale Esq. arrived in Court very late and the judge refused to record the counsel's appearance. Upon a careful consideration of the Writ, the affidavit in support and Exhibits 1- 13 annexed and the oral submissions of Counsel to the Respondent, the trial Court proceeded to enter judgment in favour of the Respondent for the sum of Twenty Two Million Four Hundred and Sixty Six Thousand Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50k) together with interest at the rate of 21% per annum until the entire judgment sum is paid. Sequel to the decision of the trial Court, the Appellant as judgment debtor filed a motion dated 14th February, 2011, at the trial Court praying the Court to set aside its judgment, which the Respondent's Counsel vehemently opposed in a counter affidavit among other issues that the Court had become functus officio and should dismiss the application. After a careful consideration, the trial Court dismissed the application for\\n\\n4\\n lacking in merit. While the appeal was pending, the initial Appellant, Mr. Babington Ashaye died and the Appellant's Counsel filed an application dated 8th February, 2013, praying for leave to substitute Mr. Babington Ashaye with Mr. Babatunde Ajayi, who is the new Receiver of Stirling Civil Engineering Ltd. The application was granted by this Honourable Court on the 18th of June, 2013, and the notice of appeal was amended and filed accordingly.\\n\\nDissatisfied with the said judgment, the Appellant appealed vide an amended Notice of Appeal dated and filed 27/6/2013, wherein 5 Grounds of Appeal were raised as herein under reproduced without their particulars:\\nGROUNDS OF APPEAL:\\nGROUND ONE:\\nThe learned trial judge erred in law when he assumed jurisdiction over the matter and proceeded to enter judgment in the sum of N22,466,200.50 under undefended list against the Appellant when the Appellant was not a proper party to the suit.\\nGROUND TWO:\\nThe learned trial judge erred in law when he assumed jurisdiction over the matter and proceeded to enter judgment in the sum of N22,466/200.50 (Twenty Two Million Four Hundred and\\n\\n5\\nSixty Six Thousand Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo) under undefended list against the Appellant when the Respondent's action was statute Barred.\\nGROUND THREE:\\nThe learned trial judge erred in law when he entered judgment against the Appellant for the sum of N22,466,200.50 under the undefended list in violation of the Appellant's constitutional right to fair hearing enshrined in Section 36(1) of 1999 Constitution.\\nGROUND FOUR:\\nThe learned trial judge erred in law when without jurisdiction he proceeded to (sic) the Respondent's suit and entered judgment against the Appellant for the sum of N22.466.200.50 on 14th February 2011.\\nGROUND FIVE:\\nThe learned trial judge erred in law when he assumed jurisdiction over the Respondent's suit and proceeded to enter judgment under undefended list against the Appellant for the sum of N22,466,200.50 on 14th February 2011 when the Respondent had not complied with condition precedent for the learned trial judge to exercise jurisdiction over the Respondent's suit.\\n\\nIn accordance with the Rules of this Court, the Appellant filed his Brief of Argument dated 12/12/2013 but\\n6\\n deemed properly filed on 1/12/2014, and a Reply brief dated 23/12/2015; settled by Lawrence Fubara Anga, Esq, wherein he formulated 4 issues for the determination of the appeal to wit:\\n1. Whether the Defendant, Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye, was a proper party at the lower Court having been sued as Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye (Receiver, Stirling civil Engineering Nigeria Limited in Receivership) so as to cloth the lower Court with jurisdiction to enter judgment for the sum of N22.466,200.50 against him? \\n(Distilled from Ground one of the Grounds of Appeal).\\n2. Whether the Respondent's action at the lower Court was not statute barred having been instituted six years after the cause of action arose? (Distilled from Ground Two).\\n3. Whether the non-service on the Appellant of the affidavit in support of the writ of summons as required by Order 22 Rules 1 and 2 of the High court of Katsina State (Civil Procedure) Rules 1991 before the lower Court entered judgment for the sum of N22,466,200.50 against the Appellant was not a violation of the Appellant's constitutional right to fair hearing enshrined in Section 36(1) of the 1999 Constitution?&nbsp;(Distilled from Ground Three).\\n\\n7\\n4. Whether the learned trial judge properly exercised its jurisdiction in entering judgment for the sum of N22,466,200.50 against the Appellant when the Appellant was not served personally with the originating processes as required by the Rules of the lower Court?

Oga, ESq., wherein he adopted issue 1 formulated by the Appellant's Counsel and formulated additional 3 issues for the determination of this appeal as follows: \\n1. Whether the Defendant, Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye, was a proper party at the lower Court having been sued as Mr. Ade A.&nbsp;Babington Ashaye (Receiver, Stirling Civil Engineering Nigeria Limited in Receivership) so as to cloth the lower Court with jurisdiction to enter judgment for the sum of N22.466.200.50 against him? (Distilled from Ground one of the Notice of Appeal).\\n2. Whether the Respondent's action at the lower Court was not statute barred? (Distilled from Ground Two of the Notice of Appeal).\\n3. Whether the Appellant who was\\n\\n8\\n duly served with Court processes and did not swear to any affidavit of rebuttal (challenging the affidavit deposed to by the Court's bailiff) can argue on appeal that the processes served were incomplete or that his constitutional right to fair hearing was denied? (Distilled from Ground three of the Notice of Appeal).\\n4. When a person is sued as a Receiver of a limited liability company under Receivership, is he acting in persona meaning that he must be served with processes personally or is he acting as an embodiment of the company under Receivership meaning that he must be served as a company under the Companies and Allied Matters Act. In other words must service of processes be personally effected on a Receiver?\\n\\nAt the hearing of the appeal on 6/6/2016, the learned Counsel to the Appellant adopted his Brief of argument and its Reply and prayed this Court to allow the appeal while the learned Counsel to the Respondent adopted his Brief and urged the Court to dismiss the appeal.\\n\\nSince the Appellant's issues challenge the jurisdiction of the trial Court, I shall formulate an issue for the determination of this appeal thus:\\n\\n9\\nWhether the trial Court had jurisdiction to entertain the suit of the Respondent and enter judgment as it did.\\n\\nIt is contended by the learned Counsel to the Appellant that though Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye was the Receiver/Manager of Stirling Civil Eng. (Nig.) Ltd, a Receiver cannot sue or be sued in his own name as receiver since he has no property vested in him, and so acquires no right of action by his appointment. This applies where he is being sued. Thus, that a plaintiff who wants to sue a receiver must sue in the name and on behalf of the company over which he was appointed a receiver. He relied on ATKIN's COURT FORMS VOL.33, S. 393(3) CAMA, 2004 and RE: ADETONA (1994) 3 NWLR (PT. 333) 481 AT 489 H. That the suit against the Appellant ought to have been commenced against the proper party, the trial Court was in error to enter judgment against the Appellant. He relied on SOFOLAHAN v. FOWLER (2002) 14 NWLR (Pt.788) 664. He submitted that the action ought to have been brought against Stirling Engineering Nigeria Limited (sued by its Receiver/Manager Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye).\\n\\nOn the action of the Respondent being caught up\\n\\n10\\n by the statute of limitation, it is submitted by the learned Counsel to the Appellant that by the Writ of Summons and the depositions of the Respondent, the cause of action in the instant appeal arose on 17/11/1999, whereas the suit was instituted in 2010. Thus, cause of action accrues from the date which the incident that gave rise to the cause of action accrued. In support, he cited CHEVRON (NIG) LTD. v L.D. (NIG) LTD. (2007) 16 NWLR (PT.1059) 168 AT 192-3, EGBE V. ADEFARASIN (1985) 1 NWLR (PT.3) 549, IBEKWE V I.S.E.M.B. (2009) 5 NWLR (PT.1134) 234 AT 257, HUMBE V A.G. BENUE STATE (2000) 3 NWLR (PT.649) 419 AT 433 PARA D. That being an action for recovery of debt, the period of limitation is 6 years and any action instituted after that is statute barred. He cited N.S.T.F.M.B. v. KLIFCO NIG. LTD. (2010) 13 NWLR (PT.1211) 307 AT 329, OGOJA LOCAL GOVERNMENT V OFFOBOCHE (1996) 7 NWLR (PT. 458) 48 AT 92 PARAS G-H, IBEKWE V I.S.E.M.B (2009) 5 NWLR (PT.1134) 234 AT 257, EGBE V ADEFARASIN (1987) 1 NWLR (PT.47) 1 AT 20. He submitted that a statute of limitation removes the right of action. He quoted in support IBRAHIM v. JSC (1998) 14 NWLR (PT. 584) 1 AT 31-32, AREMO    11\\n II V ADEKANYE (2000) 2 NWLR (PT.644) 257 AT 271.\\n\\nOn the non-service on the Appellant of the affidavit in support of the writ, the Counsel to the Appellant contended that it is a violation of the Appellant's right to fair hearing. It is submitted that by Order 22 Rules 1 and 2 of the High Court of Katsina State (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1991, the mode and manner of commencing action under the undefended list is prescribed. Thus, the writ of summons and the affidavit must be served on the Defendant. The object of the affidavit is to give understanding to the Defendant of the case against him. He relied on OTOBAIMERE v. AKPOREHE (2004) 14 NWLR (PT. 894) 591 AT 611 PARAGRAPHS A-B. That as can be gleaned from the writ issued the Appellant, there was no affidavit annexed thereto as required by the said Order, hence it is manifest that there was no proof of service on the Appellant before judgment was entered against the Appellant on 14/2/2011. He submitted that this fact was never contradicted and are deemed admitted. He relied on UZODINMA v. IZUNASO (2011) 17 NWLR (PT.1275) 30 AT 56 PARAGRAPH F-G. Therefore, that non-service of the writ with the affidavit is\\n\\n12\\na violation of the twin pillars of fair hearing which is protected by the Constitution and any breach is a nullity. He cited&nbsp;J.O.E. CO. LTD. v. SKYE BANK PLC (2009) 6 NWLR (PT. 1138) 518 AT 540, DINGYADI V INEC (NO.1) (2010) 18 NWLR (PT. 1224) 1 AT 90, RASAKI SALU V TAIWO EGEIBON (1994) 6 NWLR (PT. 348) 23 AT 44.\\n\\nFurthermore, that the trial Court did not properly exercise jurisdiction when the Appellant was not personally served with the originating processes. That by Order 12 Rule 2 and 3(1), personal service must be effected. He relied on ONONYE V. CHUKWUMA (2005) 17 NWLR (PT.955) 90 AT 114 G-H. Thus, that where there is no personal service, the jurisdiction of the Court is not properly invoked. He relied on MARK v. EKE (2004) 5 NWLR (PT.865) 54 AT 79, MIDEN SYSTEM LTD. V EFFIONG (2011) 2 NWLR (PT. 1231) 354 AT 366. That there was no proof of service on Mr Ade A. Babington Ashaye. That service on the Secretary (Ebere Nge) in the Firm of Mr Ade A. Babington Ashaye, cannot be said to be proper and personal service. He relied in support on the case of MIDEN SYSTEM LTD. v. EFFIONG (2011) 2 NWLR (pr. 1231) 354. Therefore, that non-compliance with due\\n13\\n process of law relating to the service of originating process, which are pre-conditions for the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction have not been met. He cited MANAGEMENT ENTERPRISES &amp; ANOR. V. OTUSANYA (1987) 2 NWLR (PT.55) 179. He urged this Court to resolve this issue in his favour, allow the appeal and set aside the lower Court's judgment.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the learned counsel to the Respondent submitted that there is no dispute that the Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd is in receivership and Mr Ade A. Babington Ashaye was the Receiver/Manager of Stirling civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. He distinguished this case with the one in RE: ADETONA (1994) 3 NWLR (PT. 333) 481 AT 489 H and that the Receiver/Manager in this case is a competent one duly appointed and was sued because of his refusal to pay up the debt owed to the Respondent and the same Receiver placed an advert in the Newspaper. Hence, he held himself out as the person responsible for the liabilities of Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. Thus, that contracts entered into by a company before the appointment of a Receiver/Manager are binding on the Receiver. He relied on TANAREWA (NIG) LTD. V    14\\n PLASTIFARM LTD. (2003) 14 NWLR (PT.840) 355 AT 379-380 PARAS. B-A, BABINGTON-ASHAYE V E.M.A. GEN. ENT. (NIG) LTD. (2012) ALL FWLR (PT.655 PG. 256 AT 282 PARA. H. Again, that if the Appellant maintains that he ought not to have been sued in that manner, then his appeal is incompetent.\\n\\nOn the purpose of statute of limitation, time begins to run from the date on which the cause of action accrues and the period of limitation is determined by looking at the writ of summons and the statement of claim. He relied&nbsp;EBOIGBE v. NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (1994) 5 NWLR (PT.347) 649, NDUKA V. OGBONNA (2011) 1 NWLR (PT.1227) 153 AT 168. It is submitted that by the deposition and exhibits of the Respondent, cause of action was renewed by the admission of the debt by Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd and where there is such admission, cause of action cannot be barred. He cited S.P.D.C.N. v. EJEBU (2011) 17 NWLR (PT. 1276) PG. 324 AT 342 PARAS. D-E. Also that the Respondent did not go to sleep as they immediately filed this case 5 days after the striking out of the first case.\\n\\nIt is submitted that the Appellant was duly served with the accompanying\\n\\n15\\n affidavit to the writ as shown by the records and where this is not the case; the party contesting ought to swear to an affidavit of rebuttal. He relied on AINA V. OBAIOLORUNKOSI (1986) 2 NWLR (PT.22) PAGE 316 AT 322 PARAS C-G.&nbsp;On breach of fair hearing, it is submitted that a party who refuses to take advantage of the fair hearing process cannot turn around and accuse the Court of denying him fair hearing. It is contended that the Appellant was aware of the case against him, yet did not file a conditional appearance to challenge the writ nor did he file a notice of intention to defend the suit. He cited&nbsp;DANTATA V MOHAMMED (2012) 8 NWLR (pt. 1302) PAGE 366 AT 381 PARAS. A-C. Assuming but not conceding that there was no accompanying affidavit, it is a mistake of the bailiff and cannot vitiate the proceedings of the lower Court. He relied on FAMFA OIL LTD v. A.G FED (2003) 18 NWLR (PT.852) 453 AT 471 PARAS F-G. Learned Counsel has submitted that the Appellant had admitted in paragraph 4 of his further affidavit to his motion dated 14/4/2011 that the Appellant was served with all the processes. Also, that there is presumption of regularity in favour of the\\n\\n16\\n Respondent pursuant to Section 168 (1) of the Evidence Act, 2011 and NADABO v. DUBAI (2011) 7 NWLR (Pt.1245) PG. 155 AT 179 PARAS. E-F.\\n\\nOn the illegality of service on the Appellant, it is submitted that service was not done in the Appellant in his personal capacity as Mr Babington-Ashaye but in his capacity as Receiver to the corporate entity known as Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. That within the period a company is in receivership, the Receiver is the one in charge of the company. He cited DAGAZAU v. BOKIR INTERNATIONAL CO. LTD. (2011) 14 NWLR (PT. 1267) PG. 261 AT 325. He maintained that service on a company is different from service on a corporate body. He in support relied on CASH AFFAIRS FINANCE LTD. V INLAND BANK (NIG) PLC (2000) 1 NWLR (PT.658) PG. 685. Again, that the Appellant had the opportunity to have objected to this at the trial stage. He cited the Supreme Court authority in EZOMO v. OYAKHIRE (1985) 1 NWLR (PT.2) PG. 195 AT 201-203. Similarly, that defect in service is a mere irregularity. He relied on ADEGOKE MOTORS v. ADESANYA (1989) 3 NWLR (PT.109) 250 AT 265, PARAS B-C. He prayed this Court to dismiss the appeal and uphold the\\n\\n17\\n decision of the Katsina State High Court, Funtua.\\n\\nA Reply Brief is not for a second bite at the cherry. Indeed, I see no new issues in the argument of the Respondent that should necessitate a Reply from the Appellant's learned Counsel. A Reply brief is not for re-argument, rejoinder or adumbration of issues but for addressing new issues raised in the Respondent's brief, if any. See RAYMOND D. OGOLO V PAUL D. FUBARA (2003) 5 SC 141 AT 156, (2003) FWLR (PT.169) 1285 AT 1308 SC, NITEL PLC V OCHOLI (2001) FWLR (PT.74) 254 AT 267. Therefore, there is no merit to consider the Reply brief of the Appellant.\\n\\nAs a general rule, a Receiver cannot sue or be sued in his own name as receiver since he has no property vested in him, and so acquires no right of action by his appointment. See RE: ADETONA (1994) 3 NWLR (PT. 333) 481 AT 489 H. It is in this instance that the Receiver ought not to sue in his own name but against \\\"Stirling Engineering Nigeria Limited (sued by its Receiver/Manager Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye)\\\". However, general laws have never been without exceptions. This was stated in the case of RE: ADETONA (1994) 3 NWLR (PT. 333) 491\\n\\n18\\n AT 490 PARA C, when it was held thus:\\n\\\"As a general rule a receiver as such, is not entitled to bring an action in his own name as receiver. This is because no property is automatically vested in him by his appointment. But he may acquire a right to sue in his own name arising out of his receivership, but not in consequence of it alone.\\\"\\nIn the present appeal however, it is notable that the property was vested in the Receiver who was sued because he refused to pay up the debt owed to the Respondent by Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. It was the Receiver who was vested with the right over the property to advertise same in Guardian Newspaper of 21/2/2005, hence holding himself out as the person responsible for discharging the liabilities of Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. Appurtenant to this was the decision of this Court per PEMU, J.C.A. in FREDRIKO V PETROLEUM SERVICES COMPANY LTD v. FBN PLC &amp; ANOR (2014) LPELR-22538(CA), wherein it held:\\n\\\"No company has any locus standi to sue where it has already entered receivership. It is the Receiver/Manager, who, by operation of law, should sue on behalf of the Company. Indeed the powers of\\n\\n19\\n the Directors of the Company became paralyzed because of the appointment of the Receiver/Manager. The Assets of the Company remain with the Receiver/Manager and he alone has the right to deal with these assets as long as he remains the Receiver Manager. The rights to deal with the assets inherent in the receivership can only be revived at the end and/or termination of the Receivership.\\\"\\nIn the same light, it is on record that the Appellant held out MR BABATUNDE AJAYI or as he was MR ADE A. BABINGTON-ASHAYE as the Agent and Receiver of Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. when it variously responded&nbsp;to the suits and application of the Respondent without protest to the fact that the suit ought to have been instituted against \\\"Stirling Engineering Nigeria Limited (sued by its Receiver/Manager Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye)\\\" and not the other way round. At pages 55- 59 of the records, when the Appellant filed its motion on notice wherein it sought that the judgment of the trial Court be set aside, it never out of the 9 Grounds objected or protested that the suit ought to have been instituted against \\\"Stirling Engineering Nigeria Limited (sued by its\\n\\n20\\n Receiver/Manager MR ADE A. BABINGTON-ASHAYE)\\\" save that it protested under Ground 4 that the leave of the trial Court was not obtained to institute the action against the defendant as the Receiver/Manager of Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. Again, in its Further Affidavit at pages 115-116, no such protest was made. It is also on record that the Appellant after the demise of MR ADE A. BABINGTON ASHAYE and during the pendency of this appeal applied and substituted same with MR BABATUNDE AJAYI/Receiver/Manager of Stirling Civil Engineering Nig. Ltd without any effort to have the proper Appellant or Defendant as it was before the Court. MR ADE A. BABINGTON-ASHAYE was then an agent of Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd for the purpose of liquidating the debts of the Respondent. Thus, the agent normally binds not himself but his principal by the contracts he makes. See GLOBAL SOAP AND DETERGENT IND. LTD. &amp; ORS. V BELLO &amp; ANOR. (2011) LPELR-9092(CA).\\n\\nSimilarly, where the mistake is as to name, the application can be brought to Court to amend by substituting the name with the one known in law. In such a case, it is only a misnomer which is the case in this\\n\\n21\\n appeal.&nbsp;Where therefore a party has been misjoined, the Court may at any stage of the proceedings order that the name of any party improperly joined, whether as plaintiff or defendant, be struck out or amended. This is on the application of the party that is interested and is to be affected. The Appellant had this burden on him but failed woefully to do that only now to be crying foul. This is unacceptable in law. It has been held that no cause or matter shall be defeated by reason of the misjoinder or non-joinder of parties as the Court may in every cause or matter deal with the matter in controversy so far as regards the rights and interest of the parties actually before it. See OSONDU v. SOLEL BONEH (NIG) LTD (2000) 3 SC 429 AT 461, BABAYEJU V ASHAMU (1998) 9 NWLR (PT.567) 546. Where there is no complaint against a party, the non-joinder of that party will not affect the proper determination of the issues joined. See DANTSOHO v. MOHAMMED (2003) 2 SC 42 AT 55.\\n\\nIt is foremost to note that in determining the limitation period, it is advisable to look at the processes filed by the Claimant herein the Respondent. See MIL. ADMIN., EKITI STATE v. ALADEYELU\\n\\n22\\n (2007) 14 NWLR (PT.1055) 619, WOHEREM V EMEREUWA (2004) 6-7 S.C. 161; (2004) 13 NWLR (PT. 890) 398 AT 417. By the pleadings of the Respondent particularly their affidavit in support dated 15/12/2010 and the annexures contained at pages 1-38, they asserted especially from paragraphs 16-21 that the Respondent's cause of action was renewed by the admission of the debt by Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. The company equally did not contest the debt but wrote severally to confirm the balance from the Respondent as shown in the Exhibits at pages 31-33 of the records. Similarly, the company sent an undertaking to UBA Plc. to domicile payments for the subcontract.\\nUpon all the foregoing, the Appellant now wants to hide under the guise of statute of limitation to unscrupulously and unjustly enrich itself with the gain of N22,466,200.50 owed the Respondent which the company had blatantly refused to pay. In S.P.D.C.N v. EJEBU (2011) 17 NWLR (PT.1276) 324 AT 942 PARAS D-E, it was held thus: \\n\\\"It is also settled law that generally negotiation by the parties does not prevent or stop the period of limitation stipulated by a statute from running. This however is\\n\\n23\\n subject to qualification that where there has been admission of liability during negotiation and all that is remaining is fulfillment of the agreement it cannot be just and equitable that the action would be barred after the statutory period of limitation giving rise to the action if the defendant were to resile from the agreement during negotiation...From the following it is pre-supposed that \\n1. There was an admission of liability upon negotiation\\n2. Which produced an agreement binding on the parties, and not a mere offer,\\n3. And it will be inequitable for a party to be allowed to resile from the agreement reached during negotiation.\\\" \\nSee also NWADIARO v. SHELL PET. DEV. COY (1990) 5 NWLR (PT.150) 322 AT 338-339, SHELL PET. DEV. COY. V FARAH&nbsp;(1995) 3 NWLR (PT.382) 148 AT 156 RATIO 4. In OLAOGUN ENT. LTD V SAEBY JERNSTOBERI &amp; ANOR (1992) 4 NWLR (PT.235) 361, a case of claim of interest founded on contract which interest was said to be statute barred, it was held that an acknowledgement or promise to pay after limitation period must be very clear to raise any inference of acknowledgment or enforceable promise to pay the debt.\\n\\n24\\nBeing an action for recovery of debt, the period of limitation is 6 years and any action instituted after that is statute barred. See N.S.T.F.M.B. V KLIFCO NIG. LTD. (2010) 13 NWLR (PT.1211) 307 AT 329, OGOJA LOCAL GOVERNMENT V OFFOBOCHE (1996) 7 NWLR (PT. 458) 48 AT 92 PARAS G-H. Nevertheless, as deposed by the Respondent in paragraph 21 in the lower Court, the cause of action arose on 3/3/2005 whereas the case was instituted by the Respondent on 15/12/2010. Thus, its lifespan has not expired and is not caught up by the statute of limitation.\\n\\nOn the service of the writ on the Appellant without accompanying affidavit, the Appellant has submitted that it amounted to a breach of his right to fair hearing and therefore a nullity. It is not in dispute that the Appellant was not served a writ of summons but that it was not accompanied with an affidavit. In fact, there is proof or affidavit of service that the Appellant was so duly served. The object of a writ of summons was stated In SKENCONSULT (NIG.) LTD. &amp; ANOR. V UKEY (1981) 1 S.C. (REPRINT) 4, PER NNAMANI J.S.C. as follows:\\n\\\"Writ of summons includes any writ or process\\n\\n25\\n by which a suit is commenced or of which the object is to require the appearance of any person against whom relief is sought in a suit or who is interested in resisting such relief.\\\"\\nThe object of a writ is for the appearance of the other party who is \\\"commanded\\\" to enter a defence or appear. Furthermore, the relief sought by the Respondent was clearly written on the writ at page 43 of the records to include:\\ni. The sum of N22,466,200.50 (Twenty Two Million, Four Hundred and Sixty Thousand, Two Hundred Naira, Fifty Kobo) being the balance payment due to the plaintiff for carrying out sub-contract work of stone-pitching of water drainage in Funtua town of Katsina State for Sterling Civil Engineering Company Limited. \\nii. Interest on the above sum at the rate of 21% per annum until the entire judgment sum is paid. \\niii. Cost of action.\\nIn the light of the above, the Appellant who was commanded to enter his defence within 30 days or have judgment entered against him slept after clearly admitting at page 115 in paragraph 4 that he was served through Ebere Nge by one Abdullahi Tambai on 22/12/2010 and is on record that he was\\n\\n26\\n served, now turns around to complain that he was denied the right to fair hearing. Fair hearing implies hearing the parties or giving them the opportunity to be heard. See OKIKE v. LPDC &amp; ORS (2005) LPELR-7466(CA). In INEC v MUSA (2003) 3 NWLR (PT. 806) 72, the apex Court held that:\\n\\\"Fair hearing in essence means giving equal opportunity to the parties to be heard in the litigation before the Court where parties are given opportunity to be heard, they cannot complain of breach of fair hearing principles.\\\"\\nI think this is one of the most preposterous defence on fair hearing to be made. I cannot see where the non-accompaniment of affidavit can deny the Appellant the right to fair hearing. What strake of effort did he make to show the Court that the non-accompaniment of affidavit affected the service or amounted to non-service? If the Appellant was not duly served with the accompanying affidavit to the writ; the party contesting ought to swear to an affidavit of rebuttal. See AINA V.&nbsp;OBAIOLORUNKOSI (1936) 2 NWLR (PT.22) PAGE 316 AT 322 PARAS C-G.&nbsp;Does non-accompaniment of affidavit to writ of summons amount to non-service which robs the\\n\\n27\\nCourt its jurisdiction? Per GUMEL, J.C.A. in BELLO v. OHIKHUEME &amp; ORS (2014) LPELR-24412(CA) reasoned that the object of the service is to give notice to the defendant, so that he may be aware of, and be able to resist, if he may, that which is sought against him, because without that service, he may not know that the plaintiff has sued him before a particular Court. The Appellant has at most taken the order of Court on him for granted and has consequently waived every right available to him when he did not as commanded file any notice of intention to defend and allowed judgment to be entered against him for non-appearance according to the law. This Court has occasion to tersely state as follows Per PETER-ODILI, J.C.A in CBN V DINNEH (2005) LPELR-11849(CA):\\n\\\"Where limitation of action is related to torts and contract, it is an accepted principle that the statute of limitation is a defence which can be waived.\\\"\\n\\nCoupled with the issue that he was not personally served, there is already a presumption of service and regularity against the Appellant by his admission that \\\"I was informed by Ebere Nge on 15th February 2011 at\\n\\n28\\n 1:15pm in our office and I verily believe her that the bailiff of this Court namely Abdullahi Tambai on 22nd December 2010 served her with only writ without any accompanying affidavit...\\\" It was again conceded by the Appellant in paragraph 4.5 at page 6 of his brief that \\\"a receiver must be sued in the name and on behalf of the company.\\\" If that is the case as rightly submitted by the Appellant, why should he now expect personal service to be effected on him? It is the law that service on a company is on any director, secretary or other principal officer of the company. See Section 78 of CAMA, CASH AFFAIRS FINANCE LTD. v. INLAND BANK (NIG) PLC (2000) 1 NWLR (PT.658) 685. Indeed, the Appellant did not argue the fact that Ebere Nge is not the Secretary of the Appellant but did accept that she was.It is pertinent to note that this appeal arose from the judgment of the trial Court on the merit under the undefended list procedure delivered on 14/2/2011 which the trial Court considered at page 54 as follows:&nbsp;\\\"Now, considering the Writ the affidavit in support, Exhibits 1-13 annexed along with the oral submissions of Mr. Ogon of Counsel\\n\\n29\\n to the Plaintiff, I hereby enter judgment in favour of the Plaintiff for the sum of N22,406,200:50K.\\\"\\nHaving established that the Appellant was served, his failure to file notice of intention to defend cannot save his him. In A.S.T.C. V QUORUM CONSORTIUM (2009) 9 NWLR (PT. 1145) 1 S.C., the Supreme Court on this held Per MUKHTAR, J.S.C:\\n\\\"Having found, rightly in my view, that the appellants did not enter appearance and did not file notice of intention to defend the respondent's claim, I am satisfied that the trial judge was entitled to enter judgment... as he did.\\\"\\n\\nIn all therefore, I resolve this issue against the Appellant. The judgment of the High Court of Katsina State holden at Funtua in Suit No.KTH/FT/135M/10, delivered on 14/2/2011 by Hon. Justice I.M. Bako, is hereby affirmed. Consequently, the appeal fails and it is hereby dismissed. I award a costs of N50,000.00 only in favour of the Respondent against the Appellant.ISAIAH OLUFEMI AKEJU, J.C.A.: I had the privilege of reading the judgment of my learned brother Uwani Musa Abba Aji JCA before it was delivered. I am in full\\n\\n\\n30\\n agreement with the reasoning of my learned brother, and the conclusion that the appeal lacks merit.

Justice E.A Obile wherein the Court struck out the suit of the Appellant after the adoption of final written addresses of the parties on both the preliminary objections by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents and the substantive suit.\\n\\nThe Appellant who was the plaintiff before the Lower Court filed an originating summons on 9th April, 2015 wherein he claimed against all the Respondents who are defendants before the Court as follows:\\n(1) Whether the National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is empowered to conduct primaries and present candidates to the Delta State House of Assembly election scheduled for April 11, 2015 on behalf of the party.\\n(2) Whether the plaintiff having won and was issued the certificate of return&nbsp;as the winner of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) House of Assembly, Ughelli South Constituency1\\n primary election conducted by the National Working Committee of the 2nd defendant can be surreptitiously substituted with the 3rd defendant by the 1st and 2nd defendants as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly, Ughelli South Constituency elections in total disregard of the report of the 2nd defendant's electoral panel and electoral appeal committee for the conduct of the Delta State House of Assembly primaries held on the 29th day of November, 2014, the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).\\n\\nHe sought for the following reliefs consequent upon the determination of the foregoing questions.\\n(1) A declaration that the plaintiff having won the received (sic) the certificate of result as the winner of the Ughelli South Constituency, Delta State House of Assembly primaries conducted by the National Working Committee of the 2nd defendant, is the rightful and lawful candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly election slated for the 11th day of April 2015. \\n(2) A declaration that the 1st2\\n and 2nd defendants' surreptitious substitution of the plaintiff's name with the 3rd defendant's name as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly Ughelli South Constituency election slated for the 11th day of April 2015 in total disregard of the result of the primaries, report of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) electoral panel is contrary to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) and therefore unlawful, illegal and of no effect whatsoever.\\n(3) A declaration that any step taken by the defendant in furtherance of the unlawful substitution of the plaintiff with the 3rd defendant is disregard (sic) of the result of the primaries conducted by the National Working Committee of the PDP, report of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Electoral Panel, the People Democratic Party Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) is a nullity.\\n(4) An order reinstating the name of the plaintiff as the lawful and rightful candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly, Ughelli South Constituency election3\\n slated for the 11th&nbsp;day of April, 2015.\\n(5) An order nullifying the election of the 3rd defendant into the Delta State of Assembly, Ughelli South constituency held on the 11th day of April, 2015.\\n(6) An order nullifying and or setting aside the certificate of return issued by the 1st defendant to the 3rd defendant on the basis of the election held on 11th April 2015 on the ground that the said election amount to a nullity.\\n(7) An order directing the 1st defendant to issue a certificate of return to the plaintiff as the duly elected member of the Delta State House of Assembly representing Ughelli South constituency.\\n(8) An order directing the 3rd defendant to refund all monies, salaries, allowances and or benefits collected and received by him as a member representing Ughelli South constituency in the Delta State House of Assembly from the date (sic) swearing in until judgment is delivered.\\n(9) GENERAL DAMAGES\\nGeneral damages against the defendants jointly and severally in the sum of N500,000,000.00 (five hundred million naira)\\n\\nBy the order of the trial Court granted on 26/10/2015, the originating summons was amended. See pages4\\n 152-296 of vol.1 of the record of appeal.\\n\\nRespective counsel after entering conditional appearance on behalf of their client (i.e. 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants) and joining issues with the Appellant also filed separate motions challenging the competence of the action by the Appellant and the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain the suit. Issues were also joined by the Appellant on the 2nd and 3rd Defendants/Respondents notice of preliminary objections.\\n\\nThe summary of the case of the plaintiff/appellant against the defendants/respondents at the Lower Court as can be gleaned from the amended originating summons is that both appellant, the 3rd respondent and other aspirants were contestants at primary election of the 2nd respondent, (Peoples Democratic Party) conducted on the 29th day of November 2014 seeking for the second respondent's ticket to contest the 11th April 2015 general election to represent Ughelli South constituency of Delta State in the Delta State House of Assembly. The appellant claimed to have won the primary election at the end of poll&nbsp;and his name was forwarded to the Independent National Electoral Commission (1st5\\n Respondent) as the candidate of the 2nd respondent (PDP). According to him, his name was substituted with that of Mr. Reuben Izeze, the 3rd respondent. Efforts to get his name restored on the list of contestants who won the primary election of 2nd Respondent (PDP) met a brick wall and hence his suit against the Respondent at the Lower Court.\\n\\nAfter the adoption of written addresses on the preliminary objection and processes of respective party in the substantive originating summons, the trial Court on the 5th day of April 2016 delivered its considered judgment wherein it upheld the preliminary objections by the 2nd and 3rd respondents and struck out the suit of the appellant.\\n\\nDissatisfied with the said judgment hence this appeal which was registered vide the notice of appeal filed on the 28th day of April 2016, containing fifteen grounds.\\n\\nI reproduce herein under the grounds of appeal minus the particulars for ease of reference. (See pages 1738-1763 of the record of appeal vol. 3).\\n\\nGROUNDS OF APPEAL\\n(1) The learned trial judge erred in law when he struck out the plaintiff/appellants claim on the ground that the Court lacked the necessary6\\n jurisdiction to entertain the suit as constituted.\\n(2) The learned trial judge erred in law when he struck out the plaintiff's suit on the ground that the originating summons was filed before the leave of Court to issue and serve the originating process outside the jurisdiction of the Court was first sought and obtained.\\n(3) The learned trial judge erred in law when he set aside the service of the originating process and consequently struck out the plaintiff's/appellant's suit on the ground that there was no proper service of the originating process on the defendants/respondents.\\n(4) The learned trial judge erred in law when he struck out the plaintiff's suit on the ground that the originating summons was not properly endorsed for service outside the jurisdiction of the Court as prescribed by the Sheriff and Civil Process Act.\\n(5)&nbsp;The learned trial judge misdirected himself when he held that since his copy of the originating process was not endorsed for service out of the jurisdiction of the Court, it presupposes that the originating summons served on the 1st and 2nd defendants were not so endorsed and thereby came7\\n to a wrong conclusion in law by striking out the plaintiff's claim.\\n(6) The learned trial judge erred in law when he struck out the plaintiff's suit on the ground that the suit was statute barred.\\n(7) The learned trial judge misdirected himself in law when he relied on the 2nd and 3rd defendants/respondents defence to the amended originating summons as well as the affidavits in support of the motions challenging the jurisdiction of the Court in arriving at the erroneous decision that the plaintiff's claim was statute barred.\\n(8) The learned trial judge erred in law when he struck out the plaintiff's claim and refused to entertain the merit of the claim on grounds of technicality and then entered a perversed final decision.\\n(9) The learned trial judge erred in law when he held that the limitation period started to run from the date that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) the 2nd defendant in the amended originating summons suit its list of nominated candidates to INEC the 1st defendant and not when 1st defendant published its list of candidates to contest the April 11, 2015 election to the Delta State House of8\\n Assembly.\\n(10) The learned trial judge misdirected himself and came to a wrong conclusion in law when he held that the plaintiff now appellant being a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2nd Respondent, ought to know when the list of candidates was sent to the 1st defendant now 1st Respondent (INEC) and ought to have filed the action from the date it was so sent by the 2nd defendant/respondent.\\n(11) The learned trial judge erred in law when he held that indeed this is the end of litigation. Parties in this case cannot therefore be heard on the merit of the case. Having so held this cause of action cannot be heard and determined on the merit as doing so will amount to mere academic exercise.\\n(12) The learned trial judge erred in law when he held that the plaintiff's claim was filed fifteen days (15) outside the limitation period prescribed in Section 2(a) of the Public Officers Protection Act.\\n(13) The learned trial judge erred in law when he suo motu raised the issue of the incompetence of the amended originating summons and consequently struck out the amended originating summons without affording the parties the opportunity9\\n of addressing on the issue.\\n(14) The learned trial judge erred in law when he suo motu raised the issue of the incompetence of the order made by his predecessor brother judge and therefore set aside the order granted by his predecessor on the 20th day of April 2015, granting leave to serve the originating summons outside the jurisdiction of the Court which prayer was not sought for by any of the Defendants/Respondents in their respective applications and written addresses to the originating summons.\\n(15) The learned trial judge by the decision reached suo motu upon which the plaintiff's/Appellant's suit was struck out breached the plaintiff's/appellant's right to fair hearing as well as his access to Court for the full ventilation of his claim and thus reached a final perverse decision.\\nRELIEFS SOUGHT\\nAn order allowing the appeal and setting aside the judgment of the Lower Court delivered on the 5th day of April 2016 and entering judgment in favour of the Appellant as per reliefs (i)-(ix) as contained in his amended originating summons filed and dated the 25th day of May 2015 in accordance with S.15 of the Court of    10\\n Appeal Act.\\n\\nThe record of appeal was compiled and transmitted on 20th May 2014 (three volumes). The supplementary record of appeal was also compiled and transmitted on 21/7/2016. Consequent upon the transmission of the record of appeal, respective counsel from inner and outer bar representing the parties filed the following processes herein under listed. \\nAPPELLANT'S BRIEF\\n(1) Appellant's amended brief of argument dated 11th July, 2016 and filed on same date but deemed as properly filed and served on 3/11/2016.\\n(2) Appellant's reply to 2nd Respondent's preliminary objection in its brief of argument dated 21st November, 2016.\\nThe reply brief is dated 1st March 2017 and filed on 2nd March 2017.\\n(3) Appellant's reply to 3rd Respondent's preliminary objection on its amended brief of 30th November 2016.\\nThe reply brief is dated 18th January 2017 and filed on 20th January 2017.\\n(4) Appellant's Cross/Respondent's brief of argument in response to 2nd Respondent's/Cross/Appellant's brief of argument filed on 10th February 2017.\\n(5) Appellant/Cross-Respondent's11\\n brief of argument in response to 3rd Respondent/Cross-Appellant's brief of argument filed February 20th 2017.\\nThe brief is dated 1st March 2017 and filed on 2nd March 2017.\\n2ND RESPONDENT\\n(1) 2nd Respondent's brief of argument dated 21st November 2016 and filed on 22nd November 2016.\\n(2) 2nd Respondent/Cross-Appellant's brief of argument dated 9th February 2017 and filed on 10th February 2017.\\n3rd RESPONDENT\\n(1) 3rd Respondent's amended brief dated 30th November 2016 and filed on 2nd November 2016.\\n(2) 3rd Respondent amended cross-appellant's brief dated 16th February 2017 and filed on 20th February 2017.\\nIt was deemed as properly filed and served on 22/2/2017.\\n\\nOn the 16th day of March 2017, respective counsel from inner and outer bar adopted their briefs as herein before identified.\\n\\nNOTICE OF PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\\nThe notice of preliminary objection by the 2nd Respondent is contained on page 9 of his brief of argument filed on 22nd November 2016.\\n3RD RESPONDENT\\nThe notice of preliminary objection by the 3rd Respondent is on page 7 of his brief of argument filed 2nd12\\n December 2012.\\n2ND RESPONDENT NOTICE OF PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\\nGROUNDS OF OBJECTION\\n(1) Issues 1 and 2 formulated and argued by the appellant in the Appellant's brief are incompetent and liable to be struck out as it is clearly demonstrated at page 3 of the Appellant's brief that the said issues are bad for proliferation of issues as the separate and distinct issues have been distilled simultaneously from grounds 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the notice and ground of appeal as a single ground of appeal cannot be split to produce more than one issue for determination.\\n(2) Issue No. 4 as formulated by the appellant does not arise out of any of the grounds of appeal, it is not related at all to grounds 8 and 11 from which it has been purportedly distilled and it does not relate at all to or arise out of the judgment of the Lower Court appealed against.\\nRELIEF SOUGHT\\nTo strike out and or dismiss the appeal.\\n3RD RESPONDENT'S NOTICE OF PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\\nGROUNDS OF OBJECTION\\n(1) Issue No. 4 as formulated by the appellant does not arise out of any of the grounds of appeal, it is not related at all to grounds 8 and 1113\\n from which it has been purportedly distilled and it does not relate at all to or arise out of the judgment of the Lower Court appealed against.\\nMAIN APPEAL\\nAPPELLANT BRIEF\\nIn the adopted brief of the appellant authored by Ama Etuwewe Esq., four issues are distilled for determination. They are:\\nAPPELLANT'S ISSUE FOR DETERMINATION\\n(1) Whether the Lower Court was right when it struck out the Appellant's suit on the ground that it lacked the necessary jurisdiction to entertain the claim as postulated in the amended originating summons dated and filed on 21/5/2015. (Grounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5)\\n(2) Whether the learned trial judge did not breach the appellant's constitutional right to fair hearing when -\\n(a) He suo motu raised the issue of improper service of the originating summons on the 1st and 2nd respondents.\\n(b) He suo motu raised the issue of incompetence of the amended originating summons;\\n(c) He suo motu raised the issue of leave to issue and serve the originating process outside the jurisdiction of the Court.\\n(d) He suo motu raised the issue of the incompetence of the order made by his14\\n predecessor brother judge made on 20th April 2015, granting leave to the Appellant to serve the originating summons outside the jurisdiction of the Lower Court, and struck out the suit on the said grounds without affording the parties particularly the Appellant the opportunity of addressing on the issues so raised. (Grounds 13, 14 and 15)\\n(3) Whether the Lower Court was right when it struck out the appellant's suit on the ground that the claim was statute barred. (Grounds 5, 7, 9, 10 and 12)\\n(4) Whether this Honourable Court has the power to hear and determine the appellant's claim as contained in his amended originating summons by virtue of S. 15 of the Court of Appeal Act, the Lower Court having failed to determine the case on its merit. (Grounds 8 and 11).\\n2ND RESPONDENT ISSUE FOR DETERMINATION\\n(i) Whether in view of the fact that the originating summons was issued without leave and purportedly served without the mandatory endorsement as required by law.\\n(ii) Whether an issue raised and canvassed by parties before a Court of law can be said to have been raised suo motu by the Court.\\n(iii) Whether in view of the fact15\\n that INEC received the list of candidates more than three months before the suit was filed did not render the suit stale for being statute barred.\\n(iv) Whether a matter, the merit of which was not entertained by a trial Court and which matter has serious contentious and unresolved issues can be entertained by the Court of Appeal by recourse to S. 15 of the Court of Appeal Act.\\n(v) Whether the Court of Appeal can determine the substantial matter and direct the 1st respondent to issue a certificate of return to the appellant as duly elected when the appellant did not participate in all processes of the said election.\\n3RD RESPONDENT'S ISSUE FOR DETERMINATION\\n(a) Whether in view of the fact that the originating summons was issued without leave and purportedly served without the mandatory endorsement as required by law, the Lower Court was not robbed of the requisite jurisdiction to entertain the suit of the plaintiff/appellant.\\n(b) Whether an issue raised and canvassed by parties before a Court of law can be said to have been raised suo motu by the Court.\\n(c) Whether in view of the fact that INEC received the list of candidates16\\n more than three months before the suit was filed did not render the suit stale or being statute barred.\\n(d) Whether a matter, the merit of which was not entertained by a trial Court and which matter has serious contentious and unresolved issues can be entertained by the Court of Appeal by recourse to Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act.\\n\\nHaving carefully gone through the records of appeal (volumes 1, 2, 3 and the supplementary record) and having regard to the facts upon which the appellant's complaint before the Lower Court is predicated vis-\\u251c\\u00e1-vis the respective issues formulated by the parties which I consider same in substance and purpose, I have decided to determine this appeal by the issues settled by the Appellant. This is informed by my conviction that the appellant's issue would provide answer to questions posed by issues put forward by the 2nd and 3rd respondents.\\n\\nHowever and before the consideration of the appellant's issues for determination, I will endeavour to determine first the respective preliminary objection by the 2nd and 3rd respondents. It will be recalled that somewhere before now I have reproduced17\\n the respective grounds of preliminary objections by the second and third respondents. But for ease of reference I will reproduce them hereinunder. \\n2ND RESPONDENT'S GROUNDS OF OBJECTION\\n(1) Issues 1 and 2 formulated and argued by the appellant in the Appellant's brief are incompetent and liable to be struck out as it is clearly demonstrated at page 3 of the Appellant's brief that the said issues are bad for proliferation of issues as the separate and distinct issues have been distilled simultaneously from grounds 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the notice and ground of appeal as a single ground of appeal cannot be split to produce more than one issue for determination.\\n(2) Issue No. 4 as formulated by the appellant does not arise out of any of the grounds of appeal, it is not related at all to grounds 8 and 11 from which it has been purportedly distilled and it does not relate at all to or arise out of the judgment of the Lower Court appealed against.\\n3RD RESPONDENT'S GROUND OF PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\\nGROUNDS OF OBJECTION\\n(1) Issue No. 4 as formulated by the appellant does not arise out of any of the grounds of appeal,18\\n it is not related at all to grounds 8 and 11 from which it has been purportedly distilled and it does not relate at all to or arise out of the judgment of the Lower Court appealed against.\\n\\nLet me quickly observe that the sole ground of objection by the 3rd Respondent is same in form, substance and objective with ground two of the preliminary objection by the 2nd Respondent. Therefore, I consider it proper and convenient to take the objections together.\\n\\nARGUMENT \\nThe arguments in support of the grounds of objection put together are that the general rules is that issues are formulated from the grounds of appeal but the appellant has violated the rule by distilling issue 1 from grounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and issue 2 from grounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14 and 15. To this, the 2nd Respondent argued that it amounts to proliferation of issues and hence they are bad. He posed the question whether the law allows a party to distill more than one issue from a single ground of appeal. In providing answer to the question, he relied on the case of OKONOBOR V. D. EDEGBE &amp; SONS TRANSPORT CO. LTD. (2010) 17 NWLR (PT. 1221) 181 where the Supreme Court per Onnoghen JSC (present19\\nChief Justice of Nigeria) said -\\n\\\"It is settled law that proliferation of issues is unacceptable in our appellate Courts. While counsel is permitted to formulate an issue out of a ground of appeal, he cannot formulate two issues out of a ground of appeal as in this instant appeal.\\\"\\nSee also OGOYI V. UMAGBA (1995) 9 NWLR (PT. 419) 233; NNONYE V. ANYICHIE&nbsp;(2000) 1 NWLR (PT. 639) 66.Based on the foregoing, he submitted that issues 1 and 2 are therefore defective and bad and should be struck out and the entire argument based on those two issues should be aborted.\\n\\nOn ground two, the contention of both the 2nd and 3rd Respondents is that it is clear from the grounds of appeal themselves and even when read with their particulars that there is no nexus between the ground as formulated and the issue which has been distilled from them. The issue number four as formulated, he added, raised question of whether the power of the Court of Appeal under S. 15 and 16 of the Court of Appeal Act cannot be invoked and not whether the Lower Court was right or wrong in refraining from going into the merit as postulated by the grounds of appeal20\\n from which the issue has been distilled. They argued that there is no relationship between grounds 8 and 11 on one hand and issue 4 on the other hand as formulated by the appellant. They relied on the case of GWEDE V. INEC (2014) 18 NWLR (PT. 1438) 56, where the Supreme Court said:\\n\\\"in any event, the law is settled that for an issue to be valid and competent for consideration by the Court it must arise from a complaint against the decision/judgment on appeal. Where an issue raised in a brief of argument of either the Appellant or Respondent(s) does not arise from any of the grounds of appeal as in the instant case, the issue is incompetent and liable to be struck out.\\\"\\nThey also relied on the following cases SEAGULL OIL LTD. V. MONI PULO LTD. (2011) 15 NWLR (PT. 1271) 525 at 540; AKPAN V. BOB&nbsp;(2010) 17 NWLR (PT. 1223) A21; IDIKA V. ERISI (1988) 2 NWLR (PT. 78) 563 and&nbsp;ASALU V. DAKAN (2006) 5 SC (PT. 111) 120. They urged the Court to strike out issue No. 4. \\n\\nIn response, the learned counsel representing the appellant argued&nbsp;that it is not open to the 3rd Respondent to file preliminary objection against one or more ground and or21\\n issues for determination contained in an appellant appeal where there are other grounds of appeal and or issues that will sustain the appeal. A preliminary objection is only filed to the hearing of an appeal and not against grounds and or issues for determination. He referred to Order 10 R. 1 of the Court of Appeal Rules 2011 and referred to the case of NNPC V. FAMFA OIL LTD (2012) 17 NWLR (PT. 1328) 148 at 186, where Rhodes-Vivour, JSC held:\\n\\\"If I may add to the above, where as in this appeal the preliminary objection was filed against grounds of appeal that can sustain the appeal, a preliminary objection is inappropriate. The respondent ought to have filed a motion on notice since the preliminary objection if successful would not have terminated the hearing of the appeal as there were other ground of appeal to sustain the appeal. Preliminary objection are filed against the hearing of an appeal and not against one or more grounds of appeal which cannot stop the Court from hearing the appeal.\\\"\\n\\nRelying on the case of GENERAL ELECTRIC CO. V. HARRY AKANDE (2010) 18 NWLR (PT. 1225) 596 at P. 185-186 para F-B. He submitted that the 2nd22\\n Respondent's preliminary objection against issues 1, 2 and 4 arising from grounds of appeal out of other competent ground and issues so formulated run fowl of the law and rules of this Court. He urge the Court to dismiss or strike out the objection.\\n\\nHe added that an appellate Court is free to adopt or formulate issues for parties suo motu. He relied on the case of ODUTOLA V. MABOGUNJE (2013) 7 NWLR (PT. 1354) P. 522 at 555-556. Further, he argued that learned counsel for the applicant is either inadvertently misinterpreted and misapplied either deliberately or mischievously set out to mislead this Court by subjecting the judgment of the Court in the foregoing case to a wrongful and selfishly wide interpretation. He contended that an issue could be formulated from more than one ground of appeal but more than one issue cannot be distilled from a ground of appeal. He added that an issue must be distilled from the ground of appeal. He relied on the case of ANOZIA V. NNANI (2015) NWLR (PT. 1461) P. 241 at 250-251; OMONIYI V. ALIBI (2015) 6 NWLR (PT. 1456) P. 589. \\n\\nHis argument on issue 4 that the contention of the 2nd respondent is baseless and ill23\\n proposed and aimed at embarrassing this Court and particularly, the appellant as well as being an infantile attempt at perplexing this honourable Court with irrelevant time wasting concerns which is further rubbished by the well known position of the law that the power bestowed on this Court by Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act and which the Appellant prayed for its invocation is both a right and a privilege conferred by Statute and therefore unquestionable and inalienable even by law or under any guise. He relied on the case of LAMINU V. MAIDUGU (2015) 7 NWLR (PT. 1458) P. 289.\\n\\nHe argued that it is an unquestionable and undeniable power of this Court to do substantial justice where the Lower Court fails in that duty. It is the right of the Appellant to move this Court to exercise the power in his favour and for his privilege having qualified himself for same upon the fulfillment of the conditions set by law. He relied on the case of ARCHIANGA V. A.G., AKWA IBOM STATE (2015) 6 NWLR (PT. 1454) P. 1; KAYILI V. YILBUK (2015) 7 NWLR (PT. 1457) P. 26 at 77.\\n\\nHe urged the Court to hold that the exercise of its powers under S. 15 of the Court of Appeal    24\\n Act is a statutory one which the 2nd Respondent cannot fetter nor can be fettered at all in this appeal. He urged the Court to dismiss the 2nd Respondent's objection for being frivolous and lacking in merit.\\n\\nOn the similar objection by the 3rd Respondent's counsel to grounds 8 and 11 of the Appellant's notice of appeal that they absolutely have no connection with the said ground is to say the least, shocking infantile and an attempt at perplexing the honourable Court with irrelevant time - wasting concerns. It is a baseless and ill proposed argument aimed at embarrassing the Court. He argued that it is not open to the 3rd Respondent to file a preliminary objection against one or more grounds and or issues for determination contained in an appellant's appeal where there are other grounds of appeal and or issue that will sustain the appeal. A preliminary objection against one or more grounds and or issues for determination contained in an appellant's appeal where there are other grounds of appeal and or issues that will sustain the appeal. He argued further that a preliminary objection is only filed to the hearing of an25\\n appeal and not against grounds and or issue for determination. He refer to Or. 10 R. 1 of the Rules and the case of NNPC V. FAMFA OIL LTD. (2012) 17 NWLR (PT. 1328) 148 at 186; GENERAL ELECTRIC CO. V. HARRY AKANDE (2010) 18 NWLR (PT. 1225) 596 at P. 185-186; ODUTOLA V. MABOGUNJE&nbsp;(2013) 7 NWLR (PT. 1354) P. 522 at 555-556.\\n\\nOn issue No. 4, I have observed that his submission is same in content and substance with that in his response to the ground of objection by the 2nd Respondent which has been reproduced somewhere in this judgment.\\n\\nHe also concluded by urging the Court to hold that the exercise of its power under S.15 of the Court of Appeal Act is a statutory one which the 3rd Respondent cannot fetter nor can be fettered at all in this appeal and should be dismissed for being frivolous and lacking in merit.\\n\\nIn the light of the foregoing arguments for and against, the pertinent question is whether or not the issues are bad for proliferation and whether the Court can exercise its powers in the circumstance of this appeal under S. 15 of the Court of Appeal Act.\\n\\nForemost, I consider it pertinent to bring to bear the connotation of an26\\n \\\"issue\\\", put in another way, \\\"what is an issue\\\"? An issue can best be defined as every disputed question of fact. Parties are said to be at issue when one party to an action has answered one another's pleadings in such a manner that they have arrived at some material point or matter of fact they are said to have joined issue and the question raised is called \\\"issue\\\". See the case of OVERSEAS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY (NIGERIA) Ltd. V. CREEK ENTERPRISES (NIG) LTD &amp; ABANDONED PROPERTY AUTHORITY (1985) 12 SC 158 AT 190-191; OKOYE V. N.C. &amp; F. CO. LTD. (1991) 7 SC (PT. 111) 33 at 70-71 and EKE V. OKWARANYIA (2001) 4 SC (PT. 11) 71 at 93.\\n\\nBearing the foregoing in mind and considering the facts of this case, the grounds of appeal in contention and the issues thereto, it appears to me that the second Respondent misconceived the position of the Court on what is an issue. It is trite that an issue raised in an appeal must relate to the ground of appeal but not distilling more than one issue from a ground of appeal. However an issue may emanate from more than one ground of appeal. See OKONOBOR V. D. EDEGBE &amp; SONS    27\\n TRANSPORT CO. LTD. (2010) 17 NWLR (PT. 1221) P. 180; ABIOLA V.

ALIBI (2015) 6 NWLR (PT. 1456) P. 572 AT 589.\\nOnce an issue can be linked to a ground of appeal the question of whether it is competent is positively answered. Having said this, I conclude that the objection to grounds 8 and 11 is in the realm of misconception and accordingly overruled.\\n\\nOn the objection against issue No. 4 which was contended by the 3rd Respondent which in effect run thus:\\nISSUE 4\\nWhether this Honourable Court has the power to hear and determine the Appellant's claims as contained in his amended originating summons by virtue of S. 15 of the Court of Appeal Act, the Lower Court having failed to determine the case on its merit.\\n\\nI have read the argument on both sides. The germane question is whether or not this Court is vested with the power to in circumstances like the one at hand step into the shoes of the trial Court and make the28\\n pronouncement that it considers appropriate having regard to the claim of the complainant who is the Appellant in this case at hand. My reaction to the foregoing is in the affirmative. It is not only under S. 15 of the Court of Appeal Act that such power is vested in this Court. Similar provision can be found under Or. 20 R. 11(1) and (2) of the Court of Appeal Rules 2016 which read thus:\\nORDER 20 RULE 11(1) AND (2)\\n11(1) \\\"The Court shall have power to give any judgment or make any order that ought to have been made and to make such further order as the case may require including any order as to cost.\\\"\\n11(2) \\\"The power contained in Sub-rule (1) of this Rule may be exercised by the Court, notwithstanding that the Appellant may have asked that part only of a decision may be received or varied, and may also be exercised in favour of all or any of the Respondents or parties, although such Respondents or parties may not have appealed from or complained of the decision\\\". \\nFrom the foregoing it is crystal clear that under both Order 20 R. 11 (1) &amp; (2) of the Court of Appeal Rules 2016 and S. 15 of the Court of Appeal Act,29\\nthis Court has the power to step into the shoes of the Lower Court and make appropriate order and or judgment in any given matter before it. See the case of LAMINU VS. MAIDUGU (2015) 7 NWLR PART. 1458 PAGE 289 at PAGE 316.\\nIn my view what the Appellant did simplifiers is merely inviting the Court to invoke its powers under that law. He has not out stepped his bounds. It is not a command. It is left for the Court to decide whether in a given situation, it can invoke its powers under those provisions. See ARCHIANGA VS. A.G. AKWA IBOM STATE (2015) 6 NWLR PART 1454 PAGE 1 at PAGE 71; KAYILI VS. YILBUK (2015) 7 NWLR PART 1450 PAGE 26 at 77. Where the Court held as follow:\\n\\\"The law has enjoined the Court of Appeal on the authority of Section 16 of the Court of Appeal Act formerly Section 15, to make any order necessary for determining the real question in controversy in an appeal, and can as well make an interim order or grant any injunction which the trial Court is authorised to make. The order can be made for the purpose of doing justice to parties. It need not be specifically claimed where it is obvious and should be made as a30\\n consequence.\\\"\\nIn the case of ADO IBRAHIM &amp; CO. LTD VS. BCC LIMITED (2007) 5 NWLR PART 1058 PAGE 538 at 557 the Apex Court said thus:\\n\\\"Section 16 of the Court of Appeal Act 1976, which is now Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act. Cap C.36 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004, when read together with Order 1 Rule 20 and Order 3 Rule 23 of the Court of Appeal Rules 2002, vests ample powers in the Court of Appeal such that it can hear an appeal before it by way of a re-hearing and can make any necessary order which in its opinion, can effectively dispose of not only the appeal before it, but also the entire suit place before the trial Court.\\\"\\n\\nHaving gone this far it is my candid view that this ground of objection by the 3rd Respondent and the argument thereto can not fly. To me, the argument at best can be described as a toothless bull dog. Accordingly, I overrule the ground of objection.\\n\\nIn all, both the grounds of objection by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents respectively fail and are dismissed in their entirely. \\n\\nI will now proceed to the main appeal. But before doing that, I consider it appropriate at this stage to31\\n put on record that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents Cross Appeals. I hereinunder reproduce their respective processes in that regard. \\n\\n2ND RESPONDENT CROSS/APPELLANT NOTICE OF CROSS APPEAL\\nThe 2nd Respondent's amended notice of cross appeal dated 9th February, 2017 was filed on 10th February, 2017.\\nThe grounds of the cross appeal by the 2nd respondent are:\\n2ND RESPONDENT'S GROUND OF CROSS APPEAL\\n(1) The learned trial judge erred in law when he held that the case can conveniently and comfortably disposed off based on the documents attached to the affidavit in support and counter affidavit and that there is no need for this Court to call evidence in the instant case even in the face of the conflicting affidavit evidence of the parties and thereby come to a wrong decision. \\n(2) The learned trial judge misdirected himself in law when he relied on the case of GBILEVE V.

The said brief was deemed as properly filed and served on 22nd February, 2017. Therein, he distilled the following lone issue for determination.\\nISSUE FOR DETERMINATION\\nWhether the learned trial judge was right to have held that the fact put forward in the various affidavits and counter affidavits were not conflicting enough to warrant the Court ordering the parties to file pleadings or ordering oral evidence to be led.\\n\\nIn response to the respective cross appellant's brief of argument, the Appellant/Cross/Respondent filed separate briefs of argument. The briefs were filed on the 2nd day of March 2017.\\n\\nTherein, he distilled one issue each. The issues are same in form, content and purpose. I hereinunder reproduce the issue. \\nAPPELLANT/CROSS/RESPONDENT'S ISSUE FOR DETERMINATION\\nWhether the learned trial judge was right when he held thus:\\n\\\"I have34\\n considered the processes filed by the parties on this case and I am of the humble view that this case does not fall within the class of cases that will require oral evidence, the case can be conveniently and comfortably disposed off based on the documents attached to the affidavits in support and counter affidavits.\\\" (see page 1734 vol. 3 of the record)\\n\\nHaving put on record the foregoing processes by parties in respect of the cross appeal, I will now proceed with my consideration of the issues in the main appeal.\\n\\nMAIN APPEAL\\nISSUE ONE\\nWhether the Lower Court was right when it struck out the Appellants suit on the ground that it lacked the necessary jurisdiction to entertain the claim as postulated in the amended originating summons dated and filed on 21/5/2015.\\n\\nThe argument of the learned counsel to the Appellant is that the learned trial judge was wrong when he held that he lacked the requisite jurisdiction to hear and determine the suit between the parties on the ground that the originating summons for service outside the jurisdiction or territory of the Court was not properly endorsed in the manner required by Section 97 of    35\\n the Sheriff and Civil Process Act and that the appellant did not apply for and obtain the leave of the Court to issue and serve same on the 1st and 2nd respondents outside the jurisdiction of the Court. He argued that what the law requires in this regard is for the appellant to seek leave to serve the originating summons outside the jurisdiction of the Court once same has been issued and not leave to issue the originating summons itself. It is therefore wrong to assume and or hold that obtaining leave to issue a writ or an originating summons as in this case is a condition precedent and a mandatory requirement of the law as held by the learned trial judge. Further, he submit that once the appellant has issued the originating summons as a matter of right the appellant only needed to apply for leave of the Court to serve outside the jurisdiction of the trial Court on the one or more of the respondent(s) residing outside the Court's jurisdiction where that is the case. He argued that in this circumstance, what is required of the appellant is compliance with Or. 6 R. 13(1) and 14(1) of the Federal High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 2009 and S. 97 of the    36\\n Sheriff and Civil Process Act is to apply to the trial Court for leave to serve the said originating summons on the party residing outside the Court's jurisdiction and which the appellant rightly did. He contended that by the clear provisions of S. 97 and 98 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act, it is the copy of the originating process to be served on the party resident outside the jurisdiction of the trial Court that must carry such mandatory endorsement being a concur writ and not every copy. He relied on the case of ENTERPRISE BANK LTD. V. AROSO (2014) 3 NWLR (PT. 1394) P. 256 at P. 294. Further, he submitted that in line with the pronouncement of the Supreme Court in the above case, the originating summons having been issued and necessary application having been made for leave to serve outside the jurisdiction of the Court as the Appellant did in this case, he has satisfied all that is required of him by the law to confer jurisdiction on the Court. All what the trial Court would look for is whether the appellant made the necessary application for leave to be granted to him to serve the originating processes in the suit on the respondent resident37\\n outside the jurisdiction of the trial Court. It is glaring from the record that the appellant applied for and obtained the leave of the trial Court to serve the originating summons on the 1st and 2nd respondents who are resident outside the Court's jurisdiction. Further, he contended that there is no requirement on the part of the Appellant, either in law or in practice, to first apply for leave of Court to issue an originating summons before applying for leave to issue the said process outside the jurisdiction of the Court. What the law requires by virtue of S.97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act is for the Appellant to apply for leave of Court to serve the issued processes on the Respondents resident outside the jurisdiction of the Court with mandatory endorsement thereon. He submitted that the learned trial judge misinterpreted and thus misapplied the law by the pronouncement of the Court that the appellant ought to first apply for an order to issue the process and after, that for service outside jurisdiction. The reliance of the Court on the principles in the decided case of TOUTON S.A. V. GRIMALDI COMPAGNIA DI NAVIGATION S.P.A. &amp; 2 ORS., the38\\n learned trial judge misdirected himself when he held that the Court cannot rely on such an information merely because the endorsement is not contained in the Judge's or Court's copy and so is unreliable and not acceptable. He argued further that in the face of the affidavit evidence of the bailiff contained at page 1774-1785 in vol. 3 of the record of appeal, the Lower Court was adequately informed of the fact of proper service with the mandatory endorsement of the originating summons on the 1st and 2nd Respondents as contained therein. Proof of service of the originating summons on the 1st and 2nd respondents with the mandatory endorsement. He referred to pages 1774-1785 of the record of appeal. He relied on the case of AGBAREH V. MIMRA (2008) 2 NWLR (PT. 1071) P. 378 at pages 410-411; NDAYAKO V. DANTORO (2004) 13 NWLR (PT. 889) P. 187.\\n\\nHe submitted that in the light of the foregoing where the 2nd and 3rd respondents having acknowledged the regular service of the originating summons in this case by filing processes and pleadings, they have therefore taken step and participated in the proceedings from inception until judgment, therefore, it39\\n was too late in the proceedings at that stage to be heard to complain of irregularity of service. He relied on the case of ENTERPRISE BANK LTD. V. AROSO (supra) at page 295.\\n\\nHe argued that assuming without conceding that the staff of the trial Court's registry failed to properly endorse the originating summons to be served outside the jurisdiction of the trial Court, that would amount to non compliance with form. He relied in the case of N.B.C. PLC. V. UBANI (2014) 4 NWLR (PT. 1398) P. 421 AT PAGES 449; UGBA V. SUSWAM (2014) 14 NWLR (PT. 1427) P. 264 AT P. 308, where the Supreme Court held thus:\\n\\\"A party cannot be heard to complain against any irregularity which he was a part of, having accepted, waived or acquiesced. In the instant case, the hearing of the preliminary objection which led to the ruling of 8/12/2012 at the time the Supreme Court did which was subsequently ruled upon was at the instance of all the parties including the applicant and they could not be heard to complain of an irregularity which they were part of. The procedure adopted by the Court in conducting the proceeding having been agreed by parties, the applicants40\\n waived their right and could not be allowed to approbate and reprobate.\\\"\\n\\nThe Respondents having taken steps and filed separate motions for extension of time to bring in their respective counter affidavits and written addresses in opposition to the appellant's amended originating summons, he relied on the case of PANALPINA WORLD TRANSPORT HOLDING AG V. CEDDI CORPORATION LTD. (2012) 2 NWLR (PT. 1285) P. 465.\\n\\nHe submitted finally on this issue that the learned trial judge erred in law when he held that he lacked the necessary jurisdiction to entertain the appellants suit on the grounds that the originating summons as well as the amended originating summons were not properly endorsed by the appellant before service on the 1st and 2nd respondent as required by S. 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act that the appellant did not first and foremost seek and obtain the leave of the Court to issue the originating summons before service on the 1st and 2nd respondents and that the appellant belatedly obtained the leave of the Court to serve the originating summons outside the jurisdiction of the Court.\\n\\n2ND RESPONDENT'S ARGUMENT\\n41\\n The 2nd Respondent contended that the law has always treated a breach of S. 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act as it relates to failure to obtain leave as it relates to failure to obtain leave to sue the defendant out of jurisdiction and failure to properly endorse the originating summons as required by law as jurisdiction and threshold issue. He relied on SKENCONSULT NIG. LTD. V. UKEY (1981) 1 SC 6; ODU'A INVESTMENT CO. LTD. V. TALABI (1997) 10 NWLR (PT. 523).\\n\\nHe argued that the issue is not a matter of course but there are conditions precedent which must be satisfied. Where a process which requires leave before it can issue is issued without the requisite leave, it means that the jurisdiction of the Court has not been properly invoked and the process is incompetent and liable to be set aside. He referred to the case of&nbsp;AGIP (NIG) V. AGIP PETROL INT'L (2010) 5 NWLR (PT. 1187) 348.\\n\\nHe argued that it is clear from the records that there is no endorsement as mandatorily required by law on the originating summons and there is nothing to show that as at 9/4/2015 when the said originating summons was issued by the registry or the Lower Court, that42\\n the leave of the Court was applied for and duly obtained as at that date 9/4/2015. He contended that what appears on page 50 of the records of appeal is a motion ex parte filed on 10/4/2015 (after the originating summons had already issued 24 hours earlier) seeking leave to issue and serve the processes on the 1st and 2nd defendants outside the jurisdiction of this Court. He argued that the word \\\"issued and\\\" were cancelled without any initialing on the face of the said application. The official endorsement on the said process show clearly that it was filed on 10/4/2015. This he said is evident from the date on which the Commissioner for Oaths commissioned the affidavit in support of the said motion at page 53 of the record. He added that it is clear from the records that it was on 20/4/15 more than 10 days after the originating summons was filed that the trial Court purported to grant the application only as to issuance. He submitted that the originating summons was issued without leave of the Court and that the endorsement for service outside jurisdiction was not done. Failure to obtain leave of Court before signing or sealing of a writ for43\\n service out of jurisdiction is a fundamental breach which extinguishes life out of such a writ. He relied on the case of DREXEL ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES LTD &amp; ORS VS. TRANS INTERNATIONAL BANK LTD &amp; ORS (2008) 18 NWLR (PT.119) PG. 388 at PG. 437.\\n\\nHe argued further that the Appellant cannot be heard to contend that there is a lapse which is attributable to the registry of the Lower Court. The Appellant was tardy in presenting his documents before the Court. He contended that there is a total difference in Law between the proof of service of a process and the process served. This issue is not whether there was proof of service but whether the process served was properly issued and whether the mandatory endorsements required by Law to be placed on such process was placed on the process. The contention of the Appellant is that the Respondent took step in the proceedings and therefore waived the non compliance is untenable. He submitted that the records shows clearly that the Respondent first challenged the competence of the processes, it was the Lower Court that insisted that since the proceedings were commenced by originating summons, it would44\\n take the objection along the substantive suit hence the motions challenging the competence of the suit were filed long before the 2nd and 3rd Defendants filed their counter affidavit to the originating summons on the merits. He also referred to Order 29 (2) &amp; (3) of the Federal High Court Civil Procedure Rules 2009. The defendants having raised the issue timeously and having argued, it cannot be taken to have waived their right. He relied on AUTO IMPORT EXPORT VS. ADEBAYO (2005) 19 NWLR (PT.959) 44; HAIGHTONS (WA) LTD VS. AJAO (1975) 1 SC (REPRINT) 8; SANI&nbsp;VS. OKENE L.G. TRADITIONAL COUNCIL (2008) 12 NWLR (PT.1102) 691. \\n\\nOn this note he urged the Court to resolve this issue against the Appellant and in favour of the Respondent and to dismiss this appeal.\\n\\nIn the course of reading the processes by the respective Respondents i.e the 2nd and 3rd Respondent, I found that the briefs of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents are same in substance and content. If I may add, they are word for word, hence they are the same. Therefore, I would no longer review the argument by the 3rd Respondent on this issue. Rather, I would adopt the foregoing for the 3rd Respondent.\\n45\\n Consequent upon a careful reading of the submission of the respective learned counsel representing the Appellant on one hand and that of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents on the other and the consideration and conclusion of the trial Court on this issue, it is done on me here that what is in contention between parties is whether or not the originating summons was issued in compliance with the provision of Order 6 Rule 13 - 17 of the Federal High Court Civil Procedure Rules 2009 and S. 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act.\\n\\nBefore zooming into the consideration of this issue, I consider it proper to reproduce the provision of Order 6 Rule 13, 14 (1) (2) 17 (1) (a) &amp; (b) (2) and Section 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act.\\nOrder 6 Rule 13 :-\\n\\\"Service out of jurisdiction of a writ of summons or notice of a writ of summons may be allowed by the Court or a Judge in Chambers whenever -\\n13(g) Any person out of jurisdiction is a necessary or proper party to an action properly brought against some other party within the jurisdiction; or\\n14(1) Every application for leave to serve a writ or notice on a Defendant46\\n out of the jurisdiction shall be supported by affidavit or other evidence stating that in the belief of the deponent the plaintiff has a good cause of action and showing in what place or country the defendant is or probably may be found, and the grounds upon which application is made.\\n(2) No such leave shall be granted unless it is made sufficiently to appear to the Court or a Judge in Chamber that the cause is a proper one for service out of jurisdiction under these Rules.\\n17 (1) Service out of jurisdiction may be allowed by the Court or a Judge in Chambers of the following processes or of notices thereof, that is to say\\n(a) An originating summons, where the proceeding begun by an originating summons might have been begun by a writ of summons under these Rules. \\n(b) Any originating summons, petition, notice of motion or other originating proceedings-\\n(1) --------\\n(ii) Under any law or enactment under which proceedings can be commenced otherwise than by writ of summon.\\\"\\nSHERIFF AND CIVIL PROCESS ACT CHAPTER 86 LFN 2004\\nSECTION 97\\n\\\"Every writ of47\\n summons for service under this part out of the state or the Capital Territory in which it was issued shall, in addition to any other endorsement or notice required by the Law of such state or the Capital Territory, have endorsed thereon a notice to the following effect (that is to say)\\n\\\" This summons (or as the case may be) is to be served out of the State (or as the case may be ) --------- and in the ------ State (or as the case may be)\\\"\\nS. 98 A writ of summons for service out of the State or the Capital Territory in which it was issued may be issued as a concurrent writ with one for service within such State or the Capital Territory and shall in that case be marked as concurrent.\\\"\\n\\nHaving set out the two provisions, I will go into the records to fish out what precipitated this issue. From the records it is obvious that this issue is borne out of the conclusion of the Court on the notice of preliminary objection by both the 2nd and 3rd Respondents wherein they challenge the competence and validity of the originating summons issued and served on them being parties resident outside48\\n the jurisdiction of the Court. See the motion by the 2nd Respondent to that effect on pages 379 - 393 of volume one of the Record of Appeal \\n(2) Motion on notice by the 3rd Respondent for the preliminary objection on pages 447 - 458 of volume one of Record of Appeal.\\n\\nThe learned trial Judge of the Lower Court after hearing both parties on the preliminary objection and adoption of processes by all counsel on the main suit in his considered judgment struck out the suit of the Appellant for failure to comply with the provision of Section 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act. See pages 1694 - 1737 of volume 3 of the Record for the judgment of the Court. At page 1722 - 1723 of the said record the Court concluded as follow:\\n\\\" ------ Following from the above that is having held that there was no endorsement on the Court's copy which is the original copy of the amended originating summons for service on the 1st and 2nd Defendant in Abuja, outside the jurisdiction of the Court in compliance with the provision of S. 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act, the said amended originating summons is null and void and49\\n of no effect whatsoever. Put another way the process is declared incompetent and liable to be set aside, I say so because any order emanating from this case cannot be enforced against the 3rd Defendant who is an individual left in the case.\\nI belief (sic) the case of OHAKIM VS. AGBASO (SUPRA) cited and relied on by the Plaintiff's counsel is distinguishable or does not support the case of the Plaintiff.\\nConsequently, the amended originating summons is struck out on this point.\\\"\\n\\nFurther to this is the conclusion of the Court on the issue of leave to issue and serve the originating process outside the jurisdiction of the Court. See pages 1723 - 1729 of the record of Appeal volume 3. At page 1729 the Court said thus: \\n\\\"--------- The above decision which is binding on the Court is on all fours with this objection. The amended originating summons is incompetent and liable to be set aside. The said amended originating summons is hereby struck out on this point.\\nHaving struck out Plaintiff's case as it affects the 1st and 2nd Respondents, I have no doubt in my mind that the entire suit has collapsed or50\\n crumbled as earlier stated. \\nConsequently, I find it appropriate to state here that the case ought to be struck out on this issue and I so hold as decided in the case of OKOLO VS. UNION BANK OF NIGERIA LTD (2004) ALL FWLR (PT. 197) 981. At 992 PARAS E.G the Apex Court as per TOBI JSC (as he then was) had this to say\\n'Jurisdiction is the pillar upon which the entire case stand ..................\\\"\\nAs clearly and elaborately held by his Lordship the great jurist in the decision above, the instant case has equally crumbed. Indeed this is the end of the litigation. Parties in this case cannot therefore be heard on the merit of the case.\\nConsequently, issue two is therefore resolved in favour of all the Defendants and against the Plaintiff. \\\"\\n\\nI have taken pains to reproduce the foregoing for purpose of better understanding.\\n\\nLet me quickly note that the Court51\\n either inadvertently or deliberately did not refer to the provision of Order 6 of the Rule of the trial Lower Court. It is in my view that the rule of the Court where the case of the Appellant was instituted is the first point of call before the Sheriff and Civil process Act.\\n\\nHaving said this, I am of the view that the question for consideration in this issue is very narrow. That is whether in view of the two provisions, whether the originating process issued by the Appellant for service on the 1st and 2nd Respondents at Abuja which is outside the jurisdiction of the trial Court is valid and in compliance with the law. \\n\\nBearing in mind Order 6 Rules 13-17 of the Federal High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, and upon a careful reading of the said provisions, I cannot find in the said provisions where it is required that leave of the Court should be obtained before the originating process is issued. All the provisions prescribed is that leave should be obtained before the originating summons issued for service on a party outside the jurisdiction of the Court is served. It therefore follows that the contention of the Court that leave should be sought and52\\n obtained before the originating process by the Appellant is issued and served is not correct and far from the contemplation of Order 6 of Federal High Court (Civil procedure) Rules. Agreed, both provision prescribe seeking of leave to serve but not to issue. I accordingly so hold.\\n\\nFurther to this the said provision also provides for issuance of concurrent writ. That is to say where in an action the defendants to the plaintiff's action are resident partly within and partly outside the jurisdiction of the Court as in this appeal at hand where the 1st and 2nd respondents are outside the jurisdiction and the 3rd respondent is within the jurisdiction of the Court. In the case at hand, it is only those processes to be served on the 1st and 2nd defendant/respondents that needed the leave of the Court to serve outside the jurisdiction. See the case of ENTERPRISE BANK LTD. V. AROSO (2014) 3 NWLR (PT. 1394) P. 294, where the Apex Court has this to say:\\n\\\"The combined effect of Or. 5 R. 1 and 6 of the High Court of Ekiti State (Civil Procedure) Rules is that a writ of summons shall be issued by the Registrar and can only be served on the adverse53\\n party residing out of jurisdiction after leave is obtained. In the instance case, once the Plaintiff/Respondent present his writ of summons for service out of jurisdiction dated 22nd August 1997 and his application ex parte for leave to serve the writ of summons on the appellant in Ondo State dated 22nd August 1997 to the Registrar as was done on 22nd August 1997 and the appropriate fees paid, in the eye of the law, the plaintiff respondent had done all that was required of him for proceedings to commence. His responsibility came to an end. It was then the responsibility of the Registrar to ensure compliance with the law. The plaintiff respondent was not liable for the incompetent handling of his application process by staff in the registry of the High Court.\\\"\\n\\nA quick look at pages 1677-1679 of volume 3 of the record of appeal exposes the fact that the appellant sought and was granted leave to serve his originating summons on the 1st and 2nd respondents outside the jurisdiction of the Court. The said order was granted by Hon. Justice M. Shittu Abubakar on the 20th day of April, 2015. Having done this, I am of the view that the appellant has properly54\\n and completely discharged the responsibility placed on him under the combined provision of Or. 6 R. 13-17 of the Federal High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules and S. 97 and 98 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act. The conclusion of the learned trial judge of the Lower Court on page 1723 of volume 3 of the record of appeal has no foundation or basis. I am a bit worried by the reaction of the Court to the affidavit of service by the bailiff of the Court (see the said affidavit of service on pages 1774-1785 of vol. 3 of the record of appeal). Not this alone, even the acknowledgement of the counsel to the 2nd and 3rd respondents of the receipt of the processes in their final written address did not have any effect on the mind of the Court. See pages 1717-1718 of vol. 3 of the record. It is my candid view that the affidavit of service by the bailiff also forms part of the Court's record which the trial Court ought to put into consideration in his findings. See AGBAREH V. MIMRA (2008) 2 NWLR (PT. 1071 P. 378; NDAYAKO V. DANTORO (2004) 13 NWLR 889) P. 187.\\n\\nOn the provision of S. 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act, it is my view that once a plaintiff55\\n delivers his writ to the Registrar of the Court, and has duly obtained the leave of the Court to serve same on a defendant who is residing outside the jurisdiction of the Court, he has discharged the responsibility imposed on him by law. See PANALPINA WORLD TRANSPORT HOLDING AG. V. CEDDI CORPORATION LTD. (2012) 2 NWLR (PT. 1285) P. 465. Let me add that even assuming without conceding that the said endorsement is not made, it does not render the writ invalid because such omission if at all is available would merely amount to an irregularity.\\n\\nOn this note, I am left with no other option than to come to the conclusion that the Court misdirected itself and has a misconception of the provision of Or. 6 Rules 13-17 of the Federal High Court (Civil Procedure)Rules and S.97 and 98 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act by concluding that the appellant did not seek nor obtain the leave to issue the originating summons. Leave to issue as I said before, is not part of the requirements of Or. 6 Rules 13-17 of the Federal High Court (Civil Procedure) Rule. \\n\\nAccordingly, I resolve this issue against the respondents and in favour of the appellant. That is to say56\\n that the Lower Court was wrong when it struck out the appellant's suit on the ground that it lacked the necessary jurisdiction to hear and determine the suit based on the fact that the originating summons for service outside the jurisdiction or territory of the Court was not properly endorsed in the manner prescribed by Section 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act and that the appellant did not apply for and obtain the leave of the Court to issue and serve the summons on the 1st and 2nd respondents outside the jurisdiction of the Court. In response to the statement of learned trial Judge in his conclusion when he said \\n\\\"indeed this is the end of the litigation, parties cannot therefore be heard on the merit of the case .......\\\". This Court is saying that litigation between the parties is yet to end but continues.\\n\\nI accordingly set aside the order of the Lower Court striking out the suit of the appellant in Suit No. FHC/WR/CS/53/2015. I hold that the originating process by the appellant was properly issued and served on the 1st and 2nd respondents in compliance with the provision of Or. 6 Rules 13-17 of the Federal High    57\\n Court Civil Procedure Rule and S. 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act.\\n\\nHaving gone this far, and considering the fact that the suit of the appellant was sent packing on the preliminary objection without considering the substantive suit, I do not consider it proper to go further with the consideration of other issues.\\n\\nOn that note also I feel there is no need to consider the cross appeal of the 2nd and 3rd respondents in the circumstance of the fact of this appeal. What I have in mind is that since the trial Court was of the view that he has no jurisdiction to determine the suit of the appellant for the reasons herein before stated and this Court having found that the originating process of the appellant was properly issued and served on the first and second respondents thereby conferring jurisdiction on the Lower Court, this suit has to be remitted to the Lower Court for trial on its merit.\\n\\nBy this, therefore, I conclude that the appeal is meritorious and it is hereby allowed.\\n\\nThe judgment of Lower Court in suit FHC/WR/CS/53/2015 delivered on the 5th day of April 2016 Coram Hon. Justice E.A. Obile is hereby set aside.\\n\\nThe suit is58\\n hereby remitted to the Hon. Chief Judge of the Federal High Court for reassignment to another Judge of the Federal High Court other than Hon. Justice E. A. Obile for expeditious determination on merit.\\n\\nA cost of N100,000.00 is awarded in favour of the Appellant and against the Respondents jointly.\\n\\nPHILOMENA MBUA EKPE, J.C.A.: I have had the privilege of reading in draft, the judgment just delivered by my learned brother ONIYANGI, JCA. My Lord has very carefully and painstakingly delved into all the issues in this appeal. I totally agree with the reasoning and conclusions reached therein that this appeal has merit and ought to be allowed. It is also my humble view that this appeal is adjudged meritorious and is consequently allowed.&nbsp;\\n\\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Lower Court in Suit No.FHC/WR/CS/53/2015 delivered on the 5th day of April 2015 coram E. A. Obile J is set aside. This suit is, in consequence, hereby remitted to the Hon. Chief Judge of the Federal High Court for re-hearing and determination on the merits.\\n\\nI abide by his Lordship's order as to costs of N100,000.00 awarded in favour of the59\\n Appellant in the lead judgment.\\n\\nMOORE ASEIMO ABRAHAM ADUMEIN, J.C.A.: I had the opportunity of reading before now the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Mudashiru Nasiru Oniyangi, JCA.\\n\\nMy learned brother has exhaustively dealt with all the issues in this appeal. I agree with the reasoning and conclusions of my learned brother, which I adopt as mine.\\n\\nI also allow the appeal.\\n\\nI abide by all the orders in the leading judgment, including the order as to costs.\\n\\n60\\nAppearances:                                                      Ken Mozia, SAN with him, A.V.

(Delivering the Leading Judgment):&nbsp;This is an appeal against the Judgment of Hon. Justice A. O. Asenuga of the Ogun State High Court, Ota Division, Ogun State. The Appellant who was charged along with two others were convicted of Conspiracy and Armed Robbery under the provisions of Section 6(b) and Punishable under Section 1(2)(a) of the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions Act (CAP R. II) Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004. They were each sentenced to death by hanging. The Appellant appealed to this Court seeking an order of discharge and acquittal against his conviction and sentence.\\n\\nThe facts which led to this appeal as captured in the brief of argument of the Appellant and partly modified in this Judgment are as follows:\\nThat the 21st December, 2006, the Appellant, a labourer, went to his place of work. Prior to his leaving home, he had a sick child. While at work, he got a call from his wife that the sick child was running temperature and he had been taken to the hospital. The wife asked Appellant to come. On his way to the hospital at Akinade, he met OPC men who\\n1\\n arrested him and asked for his residence and occupation which he supplied them. He was not allowed to contact his family members but was whisked away to the OPC farm. This was at about 5pm (Record book p. 108, line 14).\\nOn getting to the OPC farm, the Appellant met the Baba Bose who laughed at him and told him he had caught him at last. The Appellant was kept at the OPC farm till night and was taken to Sango Police Station and handed over to a police officer called Anthony. That was how the Appellant's ordeal began.\\n\\nThe Brief of the Appellant dated 15/10/15 was filed on the same date.\\n\\nIn his evidence on oath, the Appellant denied taking part in the robbery, that he was only arrested while on his way to the hospital to see his sick child.\\n\\nAt the conclusion of the police investigation, the Appellant 1st and 3rd accused persons where charged before the trial Court with a three (3) count offence of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and armed robbery.\\n\\nTrial commenced on 21st November, 2008 and the Appellant and other accused persons pleaded not guilty to the charges where upon the Respondent opened its case by calling\\n2\\n five (5) witnesses as against the nine(9) listed in its proof of evidence. The Appellant gave evidence in his defence. He denied ever taking part in any armed robbery operation. He maintained that he was roped into the crime due to his defending his father's land from one Baba Bose, an OPC leader who wanted to take the land from his family. That he was induced to sign Ex. D and D1 after having his teeth removed by plier by one Ejembe. His mother gave evidence as DW4, corroborating appellant's story and was duly cross-examined. She confirmed the Appellant's alibi.\\n\\nIn the course of PW4 tendering the extra-judicial statement trial within trial was conducted as to the voluntariness of the statements but at the end of trial, the learned judge overruled the objection to the voluntariness of the statements and admitted them in evidence. (Record @ p. 91-99, 55-62).\\n\\nThe learned trial Judge after reviewing the evidence of parties held @ pp. 123 of the record that:\\n\\\"It is therefore my findings that in all the circumstances of the case, all the accused persons are guilty of the offences of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and\\n\\n3\\n armed robbery as charged. The punishment for the offence under the law is death. All the accused persons are hereby sentenced to death by hanging\\\".\\nIt is against this judgment that the Appellant has appealed to this Court. Out of the nine (9) grounds of appeal raised, the appellant formulated four (4) issues; the Respondent also raised four (4) issues.\\n\\nThe Appellant's brief of argument dated 15/10/15 was filed on the same date and deemed on 09/02/17 The Respondent's brief of argument dated was filed on 09/03/17\\n\\nAPPELLANT'S ISSUES\\n1. Whether the prosecution has proved the offences of conspiracy, armed robbery or even robbery simplicita beyond reasonable doubts. (Grounds, 1, 6 and 7)\\n2. Whether the learned trial judge can safely convict the Appellant of offences of conspiracy and armed robbery with the involuntary and/or legally defective confessional statement wrongly admitted in evidence by him. (Grounds 2, 3 and 4)\\n3. Whether in view of the haphazard manner of investigating this case, the trial judge could gloss over the alibi of the Appellant when he was not arrested while committing the offence nor\\n\\n4\\n his description given to the police by the complainant prior to his arrest. (Ground 8)\\n4. Whether the learned trial judge in his judgment properly evaluated the evidence before him in reaching his decision to convict the Appellant on conspiracy and armed robbery. (Grounds 5 and 9).\\n\\nRESPONDENT'S ISSUES\\n(i) Whether from the totality of the evidence adduced at trial, the Respondent proved the charge of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and armed robbery against the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt in accordance with Section 135 of the Evidence Act, No. 18 of 2011?\\n(ii). Whether the Appellant properly raised a defence of alibi in this case so as to warrant its consideration by trial Judge?\\n(iii). Whether the trial Judge was right in admitting Exhibits D, D1 and H and relying on same to convict the Appellant in this case?\\n(vi). Whether the failure of the trial Court to properly evaluate the evidence place before him in this case amounts to a miscarriage of justice which could lead to the acquittal of the Appellant?\\n\\nAll the issues raised by the Appellant and the Respondent touch on the evaluation and application of evidence\\n\\n5\\n as required by law and case law. All the issues can be taken together.&nbsp;\\n\\nThe Appellant submits that there are material contradictions, in the case of the prosecution which casts doubt as to if any robbery took place; cites Ikemson v. The State (1989), 3 NWLR (Pt. 110) 455. Appellant submits that the 3rd ingredient of armed robbery is totally absent. Maintains that the victims PW2 and PW3 in their evidence denied knowing the Appellant but relied on the hearsay evidence. That the learned trial Court should not have acted on such evidence.\\n\\nAppellant contends that the cartridge recovered and admitted in evidence has no link with the injury sustained, no evidence was led to that end.\\n\\nAlso raised is the material contradictions as to the total amount alleged stolen. That PW1&nbsp;gave the amount stolen to be N700, 000 against the amount of N590, 000 stated by the PW2.\\nAppellant contends further that the confessional statement obtained from him was done under duress.\\n\\nRespondent acknowledged that the burden lies with it to proof the guilt of the accused and that Prosecution has done that beyond reasonable doubt\\n6\\n cites Richard v. The State (2013) LPELR 22137 @ 14-15, para E-A.\\n\\nRespondent further maintains that there was evidence led that money and handsets were stolen by the Appellant and co by the use of force.\\n\\nThat this was buttressed by the evidence of PW2 and PW3 at pages 84-87 of the record, whom the Respondents described as eye witnesses to the robbery. Respondent maintains that the Prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, there was thus no need to investigate the alibi raised by the Appellant because it was not raised at the point of interrogation.\\n\\nThe respondent also cited several cases to buttress his arguments. Among the cases cited are: EKE v. STATE 2011 LPELR 1133 SC; ODU &amp; ANOR v. THE STATE (2001) 5 SCNJ 115 @ 120; YANOR v. THE STATE NMLR 337.&nbsp;\\n\\nCan it be said that the ingredients of armed robbery exist in this appeal? The trial Court found as follows:\\n1. That there was robbery. The Court found out that the evidence of PW2 and PW3 corroborated the confessional statements supplied by the Accused. The above clearly suggest conspiracy in line with the position of ingredients of conspiracy and armed\\n7\\n robbery.\\n2. That the accused was armed. This was held substantiated by the evidence supplied to the Court. The Court treated the second issue and came to the conclusion that tendering of weapon used is immaterial.\\n3. That the accused participated. This was confirmed by the apprehension of the Appellant by the OPC. The Court drew inference of this ingredient and came to the conclusion that the 2nd and 3rd accused who were caught at the scene of the crime made statements which confirm same.&nbsp;\\nCourt stated that confessional statement of the 1st accused though not at the scene of the crime but was the one that procured 2nd and 3rd accused persons to commit the offence. The Court concludes that he is principal offender. These were reflected at pages 123 of the record. Appellant was a principal offender. The following cases were cited:&nbsp;\\nBozin v. State (1985) 2 NWLR (Pt. 8) 465; Suberu v. State (2010) All FWLR (Pt. 520) 1263, (2010) 8 NWLR (Pt. 1197) 586; Ani v. State (2003) 11 NWLR (Pt. 830) 142; Attah v. State (2010) All FWLR (Pt.540) 1224, (2010) 10 NWLR (Pt. 1201) 190; Olayinka v. State (2007) All FWLR (Pt. 373) 163, (2007) 9 NWLR\\n\\n8\\n (Pt. 1040) 561, Agboola v. State (2013) All FWLR (Pt. 704) 139, (2013) 11 NWLR (Pt. 1366) 619 referred to) (P. 1065).\\n\\nConfession is defined in Section 28 of the Evidence Act, 2011 Cap. E14 as an admission made at any time by a person charged with a crime, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that crime.\\nNiki Tobi (OBM) gave an exposition of what constitutes and is acceptable confessional statement in the case of GBADAMOSI V STATE (1991) 6 NWLR (PT. 196) 182. I find the pronouncement made therein as topical and compelling and I crave indulgence to quote extensively therefrom:-&nbsp;\\n\\\"I move now to the issue of confessional statement. The learned trial Judge held that all the three appellants confessed to the commission of the offences charged. He relied on Exhibits H, J and K as the confessional statements of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd appellants respectively.\\nThe word 'confess', the verb variant of the noun, confession, in general parlance, means to acknowledge fully, especially something which is wrong. It is also means to own up or admit, again particularly a wrong. Legally, the word\\n\\n9\\n 'confession' means an admission of an offence by an accused person. It means an acknowledgment of crime by an accused person. In SAIDU V. THE STATE(1982) 4 S.C. 41, the Supreme Court defined 'confession' as an admission made at any time by a person charged with a crime stating or suggesting the inference the he committed the crime. See AKPAN V THE STATE (1990) 7 NWLR (PT. 160) 101.\\nTherefore a statement which is made by an accused person admitting or acknowledging the fact that he really committed the offence for which he is charged is called a confessional statement. Because a confessional statement is, in most cases, a short cut to determining the guilt of an accused person, a Court of law should not take it lightly. Because the owner of the mind knows his mind best as he is the master of it, because the committer of an offence knows the offence he has committed better than any other person, once he voluntarily admits the commission of the offence, the only function of the Court, in most cases, is to convict him. There are however certain situations where the law requires some corroboration. As a matter of law, confessional\\n\\n10\\n statement voluntarily made appears to me to be the strongest evidence because it comes out directly from the head and mouth of the accused person himself.\\nBecause of the importance attached to confessional statement in the administration of our criminal process, a trial Judge must be very sure and satisfied that a statement is really a confessional statement and not a caricature of it.\\nA confessional statement must be clear, precise and unequivocal. A confessional statement should, on no account, give any room for doubt in the mind of the trial Judge. Once the trial judge nurses some doubt, however thin or infinitesimal it may be, that doubt must be resolved in favour of the accused person. By this singular act, he has vindicated the basic requirements of the adversary jurisprudence that we operate. Otherwise no.\\nIn considering whether a statement qualifies as a confessional statement, a trial judge must examine the totality of the statement as if it is a 'corporate' entity. A trial judge cannot pick phrases here and there or expressions here and there and come to the conclusion that the statement is a confessional one. He has\\n\\n11\\nno such jurisdiction.\\nWhat constitutes confessional statement is a matter of fact. It is not a matter of law. After all, the trial judge is dealing with the factual position of the statement, and that is his only interest. Accordingly, where the interplay of the facts of the statement does not unequivocally satisfy the requirements of a confessional statement, a trial judge will be in error in admitting it as such a statement See generally SHAZALI V. THE STATE (1988) 5 NWLR (PT. 93) 164; OJEGELE V. THE STATE (1988) 1 NWLR (PT. 71) 414; OKAROH V. THE STATE (1990) 6 NWLR (PT. 155) 141.\\nIf at all any statement does not qualify as a confessional statement, it is the statement of denial of the commission of the offence by the accused person. As a matter of fact, the opposite of confessional statement, if I may so naively put it, is the statement of the accused person denying the commission of the offence in the instant case, the learned trial judge admitted the statements of the 1st and 2nd appellants as confessional statements. I am in agreement with him in respect of the 1st appellant. I am afraid I part ways with him in respect of the 2nd appellant. I have\\n12\\n gone through Exhibit J, the statement the learned trial judge admitted and made use of as a confessional statement, in his judgment, and I cannot see my way clear that it is in fact a confessional statement.\\nPerhaps the point I am making will become clear if I state hereunder, verbatim ad literatim the statement of the 2nd appellant, I can do this with convenience as it is not a long statement. This is what he said in his 21/9/81 statement to the Police.\\n.....Because the learned trial judge believed that the above statement is a confessional statement that made him to conduct a trial within trial. This is part of what he said as it related to all the three appellants:\\n\\\"They each denied their respective statements at the trial. A trial within trial was conducted, at the end of which the Court was of the view that the statement credited to each of the accused persons, namely, Exhibits H, J and K, respectively was made voluntarily by the accused concerned.\\\"\\nAs a 'preface' to the reproduction of the so-called confessional statement of the 2nd appellant, the learned trial judge said:\\n\\\"Similarly, the\\n13\\n 2nd accused in Exhibit J confessed in material particular to the commission of the offence. He stated as follows:\\n\\\"Obviously, Exhibits H, J and K are confessional statements. Confessions, if voluntary, are deemed to be relevant facts as against the persons who make them in Section 27(2) of the Evidence Act\\\". And so the learned trial judge closed the curtain with a 25 year sentence.\\nHow can Exhibit J be a confessional statement? What portion of it gave the learned trial judge that impression? How and why did he come to that conclusion? What are the 'material particulars' of the facts contained in the alleged confessional statement? One can ask and ask questions galore.\\nThe factual and true position of Exhibit J is that it is not a confessional statement. Far from it. It cannot be. On the contrary, it is a statement of denial on the part of the 2nd appellant. If the learned trial judge was not quite sure whether the statement was a denial right through, it ought to have dawned on him in the penultimate five-word sentence that the statement was nothing but a clear denial of the 2nd appellant's\\n\\n14\\n participation in the crime. Let me once again quote the very important sentence in Exhibit J.\\n\\\"I am not a robber\\\"\\nSuch are the clear words of the 2nd appellant. He said that he is not a robber. And there is nothing in the rest of Exhibit J to the effect that he committed the offences he was charged with in my view, Exhibit J was wrongly admitted as a confessional statement and I so hold.\\\"&nbsp;\\n\\nIn this appeal, can Exhibits D-D1 be said to be a confessional Statement? What are the independent elements in the said statement?\\n\\nThe alleged confessional statement of the Appellant was copiously reproduced in the body of the Judgment. However, nowhere in the Judgment did the learned trial Judge subject the alleged confessional statement of the Appellant to the judicial scrutiny of such extra-judicial statements.\\nI find as instructive and historical the pronouncement of the need for judicial scrutiny of a confessional statement in the dictum of my Lord Nweze JSC in the case of NWEZE V. STATE (2017) LPELR-SC.79/2012.\\nMy Lord started with a review of the general practice as follows:-\\n\\\"My Lords, in this\\n15\\n day and age, it would, in my humble view, serve no useful purpose to rehearse the well-worn or hackneyed definition of the word \\\"Confession,\\\" having been repeated ad nauseam in cases too numerous to mention here. Some of these cases include: Yusufu v. The State (1976) 6 SC 167, 173; Okegbu v. The State (1984) 8 SC 65; Kim v. The State (1992) 4 SCNJ 81, 110; (1992) 4 NWLR (Pt. 233) 17; Ikpo &amp; Anor v. The State (1995) 2 SCNJ 64, 75; (1995) 9 NWLR (PT. 421) 540 Suffice it, however, to observe that the logic of the reasoning in all cases at this point is that a free and voluntary confession of guilt, whether judicial or extrajudicial, if it is direct and positive and properly established, is sufficient proof of guilt. In effect, it is enough to sustain a conviction so long as the Court is satisfied with the truth thereof (that is, the truth of the confession), Adebayo v. The State (2014) LPELR-22988 (SC) 40-41; Akpan v. State (2001) 11 SCM 66; (2001) 15 NWLR (Pt. 737) 745; (2001) 7 SC (Pt. 1) 124; Onuoha v. The State (1987) 4 NWLR (Pt. 65) 331. However, outside the confession, it is desirable to have some corroborative evidence, no matter how slight of\\n\\n16\\n circumstances which make it probable that the said confession is true and correct. The reason for this prescription is simple: Courts are not generally disposed to act on a confession without testing the truth thereof. Onochie and Ors. v. The Republic (1966) NMLR 307; R v. Sykes (1913) 8 CAR 233, 236. The six tests which have been admirably formulated for the guidance of the Courts in the execution of this exercise are represented in the subjoined questions:\\n(a) Did the accused person even have the opportunity of committing the alleged offence?\\n(b) If indeed he had such opportunity, was his confession possible?\\n(c) Even then, is there anything outside the confessional statement which evinces its truth?\\n(d) Was such a confession corroborated?\\n(e) Can such a statement withstand the scrutiny of the assessment of its veracity?\\n(f) Then there is the ultimate question of its consistency or reliability having regard to the other facts which have been ascertained and which have accordingly been proved. These formulations which trace their roots to the old case of R v. Sykes (1913) 8 CAR 233, 236, have been endorsed by this Court in\\n\\n17\\n numerous decisions: Queen v. Obiasa (1962) 1 ANLR 65; (1962) 2 SCNLR 402; Ikpasa v. Attorney-General of Bendel State (1981) 9 SC 7; Akpan v the State (1992) 6 NWLR (Pt. 248) 439, 460; (1992) 7 SCNJ 22; Per NWEZE, J.S.C. (Pp. 24-27).\\nBy this profound dictum of the Apex Court, confessional statement must not be taken hook, line and sinker as the truth, the end all in all of the case. The trial Court is expected to look outside the alleged confessional statement. In this appeal, was such exercise undertaken? It appears the trial Court, in an attempt to comply with this vital exercise, found corroboration of the alleged confessional statement in the testimonies of the PW2 and PW3, who were in fact the victims of the robbery. How can the statement of the victims corroborate the confessional statement of the accused when what is needed is some external element outside the scene and the circumstances of the robbery? The alleged confessional statement of the Appellant appears more like a report of the incidence which tends to give credence to the rejection made by the Appellant and the assertion that he did not make the statement. The structure, texture and\\n\\n18\\n nature of the statement fits into a typical Police style statement custom made.\\n\\nThe Appellant out-rightly denied any involvement in the robbery. He gave a sworn testimony in which he stated where he was arrested and even made assertions of being framed by the leader of the OPC men who arrested him. If any of these assertions were investigated and found to be false, there could be a probability of culpability backed by the confessional statement. No such evidence was placed before the Court because there was no investigation. Thus omission is grave because of the constitutional entrenchment of the right of the accused person to remain silent until his guilt is established- Section 35 (2) of the 1999 Constitution.\\n\\nThe Appellant raised issues about his Primary accuser - Baba Bose who handed him over to the Police. No iota of evidence was adduced to debunk the assertions of the Appellant. The learned trial Judge totally ignored these assertions of the Appellant. The prosecution dismissed it with a wave of the hand under the clandestine rhetoric that the Prosecution needs not call a host of witnesses to proof its case. One vital witness can no\\n\\n19\\n doubt prove the case of the Prosecution. However, where the facts are not that clear but clouded with uncertainty, the Prosecution must do more.\\n\\nHaving stated that the prosecution case is premised on the confessional statement of the Appellant; did the Court nonetheless consider the defence of the Appellant in all its ramifications? A close perusal of the Judgment of the trial Court discloses that the Court did not allude to the sworn testimony of the Appellant taken in Court and which is recorded at page 107 of the Records.\\n\\nThe alleged confessional statement of the Appellant was copiously reproduced in the body of the Judgment. However, nowhere in the Judgment did the learned trial Judge subject the alleged confessional statement of the Appellant to the judicial scrutiny of such extra-judicial statements.\\n\\nThe Appellant raised the defence of alibi at the trial Court and not before the police during investigation, thus eroding the possibility of investigating same at the appropriate period. Not that any form of investigation has been disclosed in this appeal. Thus, was the Appellant given a chance to raise the alibi? With the\\n\\n20\\n hindsight/facts as reviewed infra I dare say that the appellant was not given a chance to state his case at the investigation beyond stating his personal details.\\n\\nThus the principle of the defence of alibi to be raised on time at the stage of interrogation as stated above is correct. However, that is not applicable in the instant appeal as Appellant was not given the opportunity to raise it. The Court should not have ignored his alibi raised in evidence before the Court rather the Court should have tested its veracity along with the confessional statement. In our adversatorial criminal system the defence of the accused no matter how whimsical should be countenanced.\\n\\nWhy did the Prosecution not produce Baba Bose so he could be cross-examined?\\nIf this were a civil matter, one would ask why did the Accused person not subpoene Baba Bose to be treated as a hostile witness?\\n\\nThe answer is not far-fetched. An accused person has no responsibility to establish his innocence (Section 36 (5) of the 1999 Constitution as amended). The entire burden rests with the prosecution. (Section 131 of the Evidence Act 2011)\\nThe exception is only\\n21\\n when facts are within the exclusive knowledge of the accused person. Such circumstances are for example, when an accused is caught within the vicinity of a scene of crime with incriminating materials. If he fails to explain, then he must be presumed to possess guilty knowledge. Section 140 of Evidence Act the presumption is also rebuttable and the standard of rebuttal is not as high as that expected of the prosecution. Whereas a doubt cast on the culpability of the accused is sufficient, the prosecution must proof beyond reasonable doubt. A mere denial in the face of weighty incriminating materials could raise the suspicion. Suspicion however strong does not take the place of evidence. (LORI v. STATE (1980) 8-10 SC 81; ADIE v. STATE (1980) 1-2 SC 116.\\nThe Court proceeded with the mind set of dealing with a confessional statement and therefore did not pay much attention to the defence of the Appellant.\\nThe principle has long been established that it is better to let ten guilty men go free than convict one innocent man (WOOLMINGTON v. DPP 1935 AC 462 @481). The crime of armed robbery is intense, it is horrific and callous and the punishment is\\n\\n22\\n equally intense and terminal in most cases. Robbery is an act which touches the very core of the victim; sometimes right in the home of the victim, a place where one should feel most safe, secured and relaxed. A person found to engage in such intrusion of privacy and criminal act of taking by use of force the possession of his victim should be severely punished when caught.\\n\\nNo doubt, the punishment for Armed Robbery has undergone several amendments. The extant law is no doubt aimed at deterring aspiring robbers, if robbery is something to aspire to.\\n\\nHas the law achieved its purpose? Has any meaningful success been recorded? The incidences of robberies persist with daring styles - kidnapping has been added as a lucrative aspect of robbery. Unfortunately, the manner of apprehending, prosecuting or preventing these criminal acts seem to have defied change. The method of investigation and prosecution have remained static. In most cases, the investigation starts and ends with the recording of the statement of the accused person who is a mere suspect. It is worrisome that investigation seems totally taken for granted but there seems to be an\\n\\n23\\n eagerness to secure convictions. Without proper investigation, how can we be sure that the persons brought to Court are actually the robbers? There are many unemployed youths on our streets today. Some of them are in the cities seeking for unavailable jobs and are therefore turned scavengers looking for anything to keep body and soul together. It is imperative that the prosecution conducts thorough investigation before rushing to Court. The propensity to arrest and prosecute for conviction must be \\\"checked\\\" where a suspect has given particulars as to his place of residence and work, particularly, such information should be investigated.\\n\\nLife must be dignified by the application of modern methods of investigation before suspects are encast in chains of robbery.\\n\\nThe Courts too must be slow in accepting alleged extra-judicial statements often tagged (confessional statements) of suspects. The Judiciary has over the years evolved and developed our criminal justice case law. The basic ingredients of an alleged confessional statements have been set out by the Apex Court and are been severally re-stated in subsequent decisions. The case of\\n\\n24\\n YINUSA SAIDU V. THE STATE (1982) LPELR-2977 (SC) state that:\\n\\\"A confession is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding if the making of the confession has been caused by any inducement, threat, or promise having reference to the charge against the accused person, proceeding from a person in authority (see Section 28 Evidence Law Cap. 49 LFN 1963). It has therefore long been established as a positive rule of Nigerian criminal law that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is shown by the prosecution that it was a voluntary statement. The principle is as old as the laws received from England and in England the principle is as old as Hale. See Ibrahim v. R. (1914) AC 559 at 609; Godwin Ikpasa v. The State (1981) 9 S.C 7 at 29; Corporal Jona Dawa and Anor. v. The State (1980) 8-11 S.C 236 at 258. The evidential value of a confession if true is very great indeed.\\nIt is very much sought after by police investigators and prosecutors. It lightens the burden of prosecution by dispensing with the need to call a host of witnesses in cases where there are no or very few eye witnesses. A confession can support a conviction\\n\\n25\\n if proved to be made and true\\\". Per Obaseki, J.S.C. (Pp, 18-19)\\\".\\nThis principle as shown in the body of this judgment have been applied consistently over the years i.e. that confessional statements must be voluntary and must be confirmed to be so by the Courts before relying on such. The veracity of the confessional statement must be tested by the other facts placed before the Court.\\n\\nIn an eight pages Judgment, the Appellant along with two others, was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging:-\\nThe statement of the Appellant bear very unusual similarity with those of the other two accused persons. The records are before the Court and the interest of justice compels me to look into the records in the face of the evidence upon which the Appellant was convicted. It is necessary to state that the Appellant challenged and rejected the said confessional statement. A trial within trial was conducted after which the statement was admitted. The ruling by which the statement was admitted is however not in the record. The learned trial Court however unequivocally relied on the said confessional statement in convicting and sentencing\\n\\n26\\n the Appellant to death.\\n\\nIt is alleged that the Appellant was arrested at the scene or in the vicinity of the crime. There is however no evidence of the recovery of any of the stolen items in the possession of the Appellant. The prosecution did not also \\\"extract\\\" from the Appellant, information as to which of his cohorts had possession of all, some or any of the stolen items.\\n\\nThis lacuna is one that should arouse the judicial sensitivity of the trial Court in the interest of justice.\\n\\nThe Respondent refers to the PW2 and PW3 as eye witnesses but they made no reference whatsoever to the features of the robbers and the prosecution has not led evidence to proof that the features as described by the eye witness march the description of the Appellant. The PW2 and PW3 are the victims of a robbery which took place in their home. Part of their respective testimonies in Court are hereby reproduced anon:-&nbsp;\\n....\\\"PW2: Elder Azeez Salawu Omowamiwa. I am a trader. I live at No.4, Adeyemi Street, Saka Palace. Abule Iroko, Ogun State. I know the 1st accused person. On the 21st day of December 2006 at about 7.45pm. I saw\\n\\n27\\n about five people, they entered into my sitting room while I was watching the T.V. with my wife and my children. My residence is on the 1st floor. One of them said \\\"you are under arrest, everybody face the ground\\\" the next thing I knew was that my left hand was shot with a gun...that a person close to me had been arrested upon information by the armed robbers i.e. the 1st accused person...there was light in my sitting room on that day.\\\"\\nMr. Ojo - Cross-examination\\n\\\"I have never met any of the five armed robbers before, 1st accused person was not in their midst. At 7.45pm people were still outside on the street. All the people downstairs including my security man had been arrested and locked up before the robbers came upstairs...&nbsp;party member warned me to beware of the 1st accused person. The person was a pastor. I never met the 2nd and 3rd accused persons before.\\\"\\n.....Pw 3: - Mrs. Fisayo Omowamiwa:\\n\\\".....On 21st December, 2006, I was at home with my husband and my children. Some people entered and said \\\"You are under arrest\\\". I heard a\\n\\n28\\n gunshot, we were all asked to lie on the floor. My husband shouted, I looked up and I saw one short person and one tall person...&nbsp;I did not notice whether the robbers had any other weapon apart from the gun which they fired. When I lifted up my head I saw one dark and one fair complexion man. They were not masked. I did not see their faces clearly. I only saw their complexion. About five armed robbers entered our house. I only know the 1st accused person before the incident.\\\"\\nMr. Ojo - Cross-examination:\\n\\\"......My neigbhours that arrested the robbers said so\\\".\\n\\nIt is probable that robbery took place, the victims did not however identify the Appellant as one of the robbers.&nbsp;\\n\\nIs it safe then to have convicted the Appellant as one of the robbers? A rush prosecution of a person without concrete facts allows the real culprits a filled day to continue in their nefarious activities unchecked. The Police are also let off guard until another robbery incidence occurs.\\nThe case of WOLE AKINDIPE V. THE STATE (2016) ALL FWLR Part 860 PG. 1050-1055 held that:\\n\\\"By the provisions of\\n29\\n Section 1(2)(a) of Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Act, 2004, in order to secure a conviction for the offence of armed robbery, the prosecution must prove the following beyond reasonable doubt:\\n(a) That there was a robbery or a series of robberies;\\n(b) That each robbery was an armed robbery; and\\n(c) That the accused was one of those who took part in the robbery.\\nWhere the above ingredients are proved by the prosecution, the lower Court can appropriately convict and this Court shall upheld the appellant's conviction. (Bozin v. State (1985) 2 NWLR (Pt. 8) 465; Suberu v. State (2010) All FWLR (Pt. 520) 1263, (2010) 8 NWLR (Pt. 1197) 586; Ani v. State (2003) 11 NWLR (Pt. 830) 142; Attah v. State (2010) All FWLR (Pt.540) 1224, (2010) 10 NWLR (Pt. 1201) 190; Olayinka v. State (2007) All FWLR (Pt. 373) 163, (2007) 9 NWLR (Pt. 1040) 561, Agboola v. State (2013) All FWLR (Pt. 704) 139, (2013) 11 NWLR (Pt. 1366) 619 referred to) (P. 1065).\\nIt is the duty of prosecution to establish the guilt of accused beyond reasonable doubt. In this appeal, the Appellant has not been positively identified as one of the robbers. The third\\n\\n30\\n ingredient of establishing armed robbery has not been established against the Appellant. Further, the assertion of the Appellant in his evidence at trial of being framed which assertion was corroborated by his mother as a witness was not investigated. These are facts that could easily have been verified before the conclusion of the prosecution. The failure to so investigate coupled with the unverified confessional statement of the Appellant as an accused leave much to be desired. With these lapses it is unsafe to convict and sentence a man to death. A criminal trial should not be turned to persecution.\\n\\nThe Appellant was also charged with the offence of conspiracy to commit armed robbery. In the case of Alufohai v. State (2014) LPELR-24215. My Lord Ariwoola JSC defined conspiracy as&nbsp;\\n\\\".....an agreement between two or more persons to do an unlawful act. It is a matter of inference, deduced from certain criminal acts of the parties accused, done in pursuance of an apparent criminal purpose in common between them and which hardly are ever confined to one place. Therefore, failure to prove a substantive offence does not make conviction\\n\\n31\\n for conspiracy inappropriate, as it is, in itself a separate and distinct offence, independent of the actual offence conspired to commit\\\". (See also Oduneye v. State (2001) 2 NWLR (Pt. 697) p. 311; The State v. Olashehu Salawu (2011) LPELR-8252).\\n\\nIt is instructive that apart from the alleged confessional statement of the Appellant, there is nothing external to the statement which corroborates the allegation of a common associate between the Appellant and the other accused persons. This apathy of co-relation creates a doubt which ought to be resolved in favour of the Appellant as provided by Section 36(5) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.&nbsp;\\n\\nThe reason given by the learned trial Court for preferring the case of the Prosecution is stated at pg 7 (122) of the records. His Lordship held that:\\n\\\"....All the confessional statement of the entire three accused person gave a detailed description of how the robbery operation was planned and executed and how they were arrested, the confessional statements tally with the description of how the robbery operation was carried out given by the victims Pw2 and Pw3.\\n\\n32\\n The truth of the confessional statements has thus been tested\\\".\\n\\nExhibit 'D' which is the 2nd accused person's (DW3) statement states and I quote:\\n\\\"I know Mr. Segun Odunayo a.k.a pastor at Iyana School Abule Iroko, Sango Ota where his house is, he told me that one Chief Azeez Omowamiwa is sponsoring Hon. Abiola generation to be a House of Assembly member. He has money and he wants us to go and rob him. That was on Monday 16-12-06, on 18-12-06 Mr. Segun Odunayo a.k.a pastor took me to Chief Azeez Omowamiwa's house. We discussed that after the operation his share will be N50,000.00.\\nOn 21-12-2006 Abbey 'M' Ahmed Salami 'M', Moses 'M' and two other men whom I do not know their names came to meet (sic) me at Saka Abule Iroko Sango Ota at about 8.00pm and six of left to Chief Azeez Omowamiwa's house. Abbey was with the long gun, Moses with the short gun. As we got there, Abbey fired the Chief and he fell down I went and stabbed (sic) thigh to see if he is dead. We robbed him about N690,000.00 (Six Hundred and Ninety Thousand\\n\\n33\\n Naira)...As we were robbing Chief Azeez Omowamiwa and his family, people shouted Ole, Ole- robber, so we ran away and I entered Hammed 'M' Okada as we were running away OPC men and other people chased us and caught me and Hammed. OPC men handed us over to the Police at Sango-Ota Police Station. As a matter of fact myself, Abbey and Moses are the ones that throw the wife and son of Chief Azeez Omowamiwa down from the upstairs when they failed to bring out more money.\\\"&nbsp;\\n\\nIn the entire judgment, the learned trial Court dwelt more on the fact of the robbery and paid little or no attention at all to the protestations of the Appellant. Was the Court correct in admitting the extra-judicial statement of the Appellant as a confession? Were the characteristics of a confessional statement\\n\\n34\\n discernible from the evidence before the Court? I find not so in this appeal for reasons already highlighted in line with the cases cited in this Judgment.\\n\\nNo doubt proof beyond reasonable doubt is not attained by the number of witnesses fielded by the Prosecution. It depends on the quality of the evidence tendered by the Prosecution. (See Akalezi v State (1993) 2 NWLR (pt. 273) 1. However, some witnesses are vital and failure to call them deal a fatal blow to the case of the prosecution. In this appeal Baba Bose is one of such vital witnesses who was missing in action among the Prosecution witnesses.\\n\\nProof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all shadow of doubt, and if the evidence is strong against a man, as to leave only a remote probability in his favour, which can be dismissed with the sentence: \\\"of course it is possible, but not in the least probable\\\". The case is proved beyond reasonable doubt. (Akalezi v State (1993) 2 NWLR (pt. 273) 1).\\nIt is correct that proof beyond reasonable doubt is also not proof beyond all shadow of doubt. (DIBIE &amp;ORS v. THE STATE 2007 9 NWLR pt.1038, 30; AKALEZI v. STATE\\n\\n35\\n 1993 2 NWLR pt.273, 1). In this appeal, the doubt raised is more than a shadow of doubt. It is substantial especially as it relates to the arresting OPC outfit. No doubt, the OPC is an essential voluntary organ in crime prevention and detection. It is nonetheless a human body with all the excesses of human weaknesses.\\n\\nAccordingly, I am unable to affirm the decision of the learned trial Court in convicting and sentencing the Appellant to death.&nbsp;\\n\\nI therefore allow this appeal as meritorious and hereby quash the conviction and sentence of the Appellant who is hereby discharged and acquitted.\\nThe decision of the Ogun State High Court Coram A. O. Asenuga (J) is hereby set aside.&nbsp;\\n\\nIt is hereby ordered that the Appellant be released forthwith from prison custody.\\n\\nCHINWE EUGENIA IYIZOBA, J.C.A.:&nbsp;I agree\\n\\nHARUNA SIMON TSAMMANI, J.C.A.:&nbsp;I read the draft of the judgment delivered by my learned brother, Monica B. Dongban-Mensem, JCA.\\n\\nI agree that the appeal has merit and it is accordingly affirmed.

Justice I.M. Bako, wherein the claims of the Respondent against the Appellant for the sum of N22,466,200.50 under the undefended list were granted.\\n\\nThe Respondent's Claims at the lower Court against the Appellant under the \\\"Undefended List\\\" vide the Statement of Claim dated 20/12/2010 contained at pages 43-44 of the records were as follows:\\n1. The sum of N22.466.200,50 (Twenty Two Million, Four Hundred and sixty six Thousand, Two Hundred Naira, Fifty Kobo) being the balance payment due to the plaintiff for carrying out sub-contract work of stone-pitching of water drainage in Funtua town of Katsina State for Sterling Civil Engineering Company Limited.\\n2. Interest on the above sum at the rate of 21% per annum until the entire judgment sum is paid.\\n3. Cost of action.\\n\\nThe Respondent commenced an action at the Federal High Court Katsina, against Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye under the undefended list procedure\\n1\\nclaiming the sum of Twenty Two Million, Four Hundred and sixty Six Thousand, Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50K) being the balance of payment due to the Respondent for carrying out sub-contract work of stone pitching of water drainage in Funtua town of Katsina State for Stirling Civil Engineering Nigeria Ltd. Judgment was entered in favour of the Respondent and the Appellant being dissatisfied appealed to this Honourable Court. This Honourable Court in appeal No. CA/K/201/2008 allowed the appeal in a judgment delivered on 15th December, 2010, on the ground that the Federal High Court, Katsina, lacked jurisdiction to entertain the action; hence the judgment was set aside and the suit struck out. Consequently, the Respondent filed a fresh action before the High Court of Katsina State in Suit No: KTH/FT/135M/2010 against Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye (Receiver/Manager Stirling Civil Engineering Nig. Ltd.) under the undefended list procedure claiming Twenty Two Million Four Hundred and Sixty Six Thousand Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50K) being the balance payment due to the Plaintiff for carrying out sub-contract work of stone\\n2\\n pitching of water drainage in Funtua town of Katsina State for Stirling Civil Engineering Nigeria Ltd.\\n\\nThe Respondent applied at the trial Court for the matter to be placed on the Undefended List pursuant to Order 22 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules Cap 60 Laws of Katsina State, 1991 and being satisfied that the requirements of the Rules of Court had been met, the Court granted the application. Furthermore, the Respondent obtained the leave of Court to serve the originating processes on the Appellant outside jurisdiction and the bailiff of the trial Court served the writ of summons and accompanying affidavit with the order of the Court granting leave to serve outside jurisdiction (which was obtained ex parte) on the Appellant's secretary, one Miss Ebere Nge of Babington Ashaye &amp; Co. The bailiff of the trial Court filed a proof of service of the originating processes on the Appellant and also delivered the processes to the Appellant's Counsel at his chambers but no step was taken to file any notice of intention to defend the action. On 14th February, 2011, when the matter came up for hearing, the Appellant was absent and unrepresented by\\n\\n3\\n Counsel. No notice of intention to defend the action was filed by the Appellant. However, during the course of the proceedings, just when the Court was about pronouncing its judgment, counsel to the Appellant, Mr. O.A. Orewale Esq. arrived in Court very late and the judge refused to record the counsel's appearance. Upon a careful consideration of the Writ, the affidavit in support and Exhibits 1- 13 annexed and the oral submissions of Counsel to the Respondent, the trial Court proceeded to enter judgment in favour of the Respondent for the sum of Twenty Two Million Four Hundred and Sixty Six Thousand Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50k) together with interest at the rate of 21% per annum until the entire judgment sum is paid. Sequel to the decision of the trial Court, the Appellant as judgment debtor filed a motion dated 14th February, 2011, at the trial Court praying the Court to set aside its judgment, which the Respondent's Counsel vehemently opposed in a counter affidavit among other issues that the Court had become functus officio and should dismiss the application. After a careful consideration, the trial Court dismissed the application for\\n\\n4\\n lacking in merit. While the appeal was pending, the initial Appellant, Mr. Babington Ashaye died and the Appellant's Counsel filed an application dated 8th February, 2013, praying for leave to substitute Mr. Babington Ashaye with Mr. Babatunde Ajayi, who is the new Receiver of Stirling Civil Engineering Ltd. The application was granted by this Honourable Court on the 18th of June, 2013, and the notice of appeal was amended and filed accordingly.\\n\\nDissatisfied with the said judgment, the Appellant appealed vide an amended Notice of Appeal dated and filed 27/6/2013, wherein 5 Grounds of Appeal were raised as herein under reproduced without their particulars:\\nGROUNDS OF APPEAL:\\nGROUND ONE:\\nThe learned trial judge erred in law when he assumed jurisdiction over the matter and proceeded to enter judgment in the sum of N22,466,200.50 under undefended list against the Appellant when the Appellant was not a proper party to the suit.\\nGROUND TWO:\\nThe learned trial judge erred in law when he assumed jurisdiction over the matter and proceeded to enter judgment in the sum of N22,466/200.50 (Twenty Two Million Four Hundred and\\n\\n5\\nSixty Six Thousand Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo) under undefended list against the Appellant when the Respondent's action was statute Barred.\\nGROUND THREE:\\nThe learned trial judge erred in law when he entered judgment against the Appellant for the sum of N22,466,200.50 under the undefended list in violation of the Appellant's constitutional right to fair hearing enshrined in Section 36(1) of 1999 Constitution.\\nGROUND FOUR:\\nThe learned trial judge erred in law when without jurisdiction he proceeded to (sic) the Respondent's suit and entered judgment against the Appellant for the sum of N22.466.200.50 on 14th February 2011.\\nGROUND FIVE:\\nThe learned trial judge erred in law when he assumed jurisdiction over the Respondent's suit and proceeded to enter judgment under undefended list against the Appellant for the sum of N22,466,200.50 on 14th February 2011 when the Respondent had not complied with condition precedent for the learned trial judge to exercise jurisdiction over the Respondent's suit.\\n\\nIn accordance with the Rules of this Court, the Appellant filed his Brief of Argument dated 12/12/2013 but\\n6\\n deemed properly filed on 1/12/2014, and a Reply brief dated 23/12/2015; settled by Lawrence Fubara Anga, Esq, wherein he formulated 4 issues for the determination of the appeal to wit:\\n1. Whether the Defendant, Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye, was a proper party at the lower Court having been sued as Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye (Receiver, Stirling civil Engineering Nigeria Limited in Receivership) so as to cloth the lower Court with jurisdiction to enter judgment for the sum of N22.466,200.50 against him? \\n(Distilled from Ground one of the Grounds of Appeal).\\n2. Whether the Respondent's action at the lower Court was not statute barred having been instituted six years after the cause of action arose? (Distilled from Ground Two).\\n3. Whether the non-service on the Appellant of the affidavit in support of the writ of summons as required by Order 22 Rules 1 and 2 of the High court of Katsina State (Civil Procedure) Rules 1991 before the lower Court entered judgment for the sum of N22,466,200.50 against the Appellant was not a violation of the Appellant's constitutional right to fair hearing enshrined in Section 36(1) of the 1999 Constitution?&nbsp;(Distilled from Ground Three).\\n\\n7\\n4. Whether the learned trial judge properly exercised its jurisdiction in entering judgment for the sum of N22,466,200.50 against the Appellant when the Appellant was not served personally with the originating processes as required by the Rules of the lower Court? (Distilled from Ground Four).\\n\\nThe Respondent filed his brief dated 19/3/2015 but deemed properly filed on 9/11/2015; settled by L.E. Oga, ESq., wherein he adopted issue 1 formulated by the Appellant's Counsel and formulated additional 3 issues for the determination of this appeal as follows: \\n1. Whether the Defendant, Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye, was a proper party at the lower Court having been sued as Mr. Ade A.&nbsp;Babington Ashaye (Receiver, Stirling Civil Engineering Nigeria Limited in Receivership) so as to cloth the lower Court with jurisdiction to enter judgment for the sum of N22.466.200.50 against him? (Distilled from Ground one of the Notice of Appeal).\\n2. Whether the Respondent's action at the lower Court was not statute barred? (Distilled from Ground Two of the Notice of Appeal).\\n3. Whether the Appellant who was\\n\\n8\\n duly served with Court processes and did not swear to any affidavit of rebuttal (challenging the affidavit deposed to by the Court's bailiff) can argue on appeal that the processes served were incomplete or that his constitutional right to fair hearing was denied? (Distilled from Ground three of the Notice of Appeal).\\n4. When a person is sued as a Receiver of a limited liability company under Receivership, is he acting in persona meaning that he must be served with processes personally or is he acting as an embodiment of the company under Receivership meaning that he must be served as a company under the Companies and Allied Matters Act. In other words must service of processes be personally effected on a Receiver?\\n\\nAt the hearing of the appeal on 6/6/2016, the learned Counsel to the Appellant adopted his Brief of argument and its Reply and prayed this Court to allow the appeal while the learned Counsel to the Respondent adopted his Brief and urged the Court to dismiss the appeal.\\n\\nSince the Appellant's issues challenge the jurisdiction of the trial Court, I shall formulate an issue for the determination of this appeal thus:\\n\\n9\\nWhether the trial Court had jurisdiction to entertain the suit of the Respondent and enter judgment as it did.\\n\\nIt is contended by the learned Counsel to the Appellant that though Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye was the Receiver/Manager of Stirling Civil Eng. (Nig.) Ltd, a Receiver cannot sue or be sued in his own name as receiver since he has no property vested in him, and so acquires no right of action by his appointment. This applies where he is being sued. Thus, that a plaintiff who wants to sue a receiver must sue in the name and on behalf of the company over which he was appointed a receiver. He relied on ATKIN's COURT FORMS VOL.33, S. 393(3) CAMA, 2004 and RE: ADETONA (1994) 3 NWLR (PT. 333) 481 AT 489 H. That the suit against the Appellant ought to have been commenced against the proper party, the trial Court was in error to enter judgment against the Appellant. He relied on SOFOLAHAN v. FOWLER (2002) 14 NWLR (Pt.788) 664. He submitted that the action ought to have been brought against Stirling Engineering Nigeria Limited (sued by its Receiver/Manager Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye).\\n\\nOn the action of the Respondent being caught up\\n\\n10\\n by the statute of limitation, it is submitted by the learned Counsel to the Appellant that by the Writ of Summons and the depositions of the Respondent, the cause of action in the instant appeal arose on 17/11/1999, whereas the suit was instituted in 2010. Thus, cause of action accrues from the date which the incident that gave rise to the cause of action accrued. In support, he cited CHEVRON (NIG) LTD. v L.D. (NIG) LTD. (2007) 16 NWLR (PT.1059) 168 AT 192-3, EGBE V. ADEFARASIN (1985) 1 NWLR (PT.3) 549, IBEKWE V I.S.E.M.B. (2009) 5 NWLR (PT.1134) 234 AT 257, HUMBE V A.G. BENUE STATE (2000) 3 NWLR (PT.649) 419 AT 433 PARA D. That being an action for recovery of debt, the period of limitation is 6 years and any action instituted after that is statute barred. He cited N.S.T.F.M.B. v. KLIFCO NIG. LTD. (2010) 13 NWLR (PT.1211) 307 AT 329, OGOJA LOCAL GOVERNMENT V OFFOBOCHE (1996) 7 NWLR (PT. 458) 48 AT 92 PARAS G-H, IBEKWE V I.S.E.M.B (2009) 5 NWLR (PT.1134) 234 AT 257, EGBE V ADEFARASIN (1987) 1 NWLR (PT.47) 1 AT 20. He submitted that a statute of limitation removes the right of action. He quoted in support IBRAHIM v. JSC (1998) 14 NWLR (PT. 584) 1 AT 31-32, AREMO    11\\n II V ADEKANYE (2000) 2 NWLR (PT.644) 257 AT 271.\\n\\nOn the non-service on the Appellant of the affidavit in support of the writ, the Counsel to the Appellant contended that it is a violation of the Appellant's right to fair hearing. It is submitted that by Order 22 Rules 1 and 2 of the High Court of Katsina State (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1991, the mode and manner of commencing action under the undefended list is prescribed. Thus, the writ of summons and the affidavit must be served on the Defendant. The object of the affidavit is to give understanding to the Defendant of the case against him. He relied on OTOBAIMERE v. AKPOREHE (2004) 14 NWLR (PT. 894) 591 AT 611 PARAGRAPHS A-B. That as can be gleaned from the writ issued the Appellant, there was no affidavit annexed thereto as required by the said Order, hence it is manifest that there was no proof of service on the Appellant before judgment was entered against the Appellant on 14/2/2011. He submitted that this fact was never contradicted and are deemed admitted. He relied on UZODINMA v. IZUNASO (2011) 17 NWLR (PT.1275) 30 AT 56 PARAGRAPH F-G. Therefore, that non-service of the writ with the affidavit is\\n\\n12\\na violation of the twin pillars of fair hearing which is protected by the Constitution and any breach is a nullity. He cited&nbsp;J.O.E. CO. LTD. v. SKYE BANK PLC (2009) 6 NWLR (PT. 1138) 518 AT 540, DINGYADI V INEC (NO.1) (2010) 18 NWLR (PT. 1224) 1 AT 90, RASAKI SALU V TAIWO EGEIBON (1994) 6 NWLR (PT. 348) 23 AT 44.\\n\\nFurthermore, that the trial Court did not properly exercise jurisdiction when the Appellant was not personally served with the originating processes. That by Order 12 Rule 2 and 3(1), personal service must be effected. He relied on ONONYE V. CHUKWUMA (2005) 17 NWLR (PT.955) 90 AT 114 G-H. Thus, that where there is no personal service, the jurisdiction of the Court is not properly invoked. He relied on MARK v. EKE (2004) 5 NWLR (PT.865) 54 AT 79, MIDEN SYSTEM LTD. V EFFIONG (2011) 2 NWLR (PT. 1231) 354 AT 366. That there was no proof of service on Mr Ade A. Babington Ashaye. That service on the Secretary (Ebere Nge) in the Firm of Mr Ade A. Babington Ashaye, cannot be said to be proper and personal service. He relied in support on the case of MIDEN SYSTEM LTD. v. EFFIONG (2011) 2 NWLR (pr. 1231) 354. Therefore, that non-compliance with due\\n13\\n process of law relating to the service of originating process, which are pre-conditions for the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction have not been met. He cited MANAGEMENT ENTERPRISES &amp; ANOR. V. OTUSANYA (1987) 2 NWLR (PT.55) 179. He urged this Court to resolve this issue in his favour, allow the appeal and set aside the lower Court's judgment.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the learned counsel to the Respondent submitted that there is no dispute that the Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd is in receivership and Mr Ade A. Babington Ashaye was the Receiver/Manager of Stirling civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. He distinguished this case with the one in RE: ADETONA (1994) 3 NWLR (PT. 333) 481 AT 489 H and that the Receiver/Manager in this case is a competent one duly appointed and was sued because of his refusal to pay up the debt owed to the Respondent and the same Receiver placed an advert in the Newspaper. Hence, he held himself out as the person responsible for the liabilities of Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. Thus, that contracts entered into by a company before the appointment of a Receiver/Manager are binding on the Receiver. He relied on TANAREWA (NIG) LTD. V    14\\n PLASTIFARM LTD. (2003) 14 NWLR (PT.840) 355 AT 379-380 PARAS. B-A, BABINGTON-ASHAYE V E.M.A. GEN. ENT. (NIG) LTD. (2012) ALL FWLR (PT.655 PG. 256 AT 282 PARA. H. Again, that if the Appellant maintains that he ought not to have been sued in that manner, then his appeal is incompetent.\\n\\nOn the purpose of statute of limitation, time begins to run from the date on which the cause of action accrues and the period of limitation is determined by looking at the writ of summons and the statement of claim. He relied&nbsp;EBOIGBE v. NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (1994) 5 NWLR (PT.347) 649, NDUKA V. OGBONNA (2011) 1 NWLR (PT.1227) 153 AT 168. It is submitted that by the deposition and exhibits of the Respondent, cause of action was renewed by the admission of the debt by Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd and where there is such admission, cause of action cannot be barred. He cited S.P.D.C.N. v. EJEBU (2011) 17 NWLR (PT. 1276) PG. 324 AT 342 PARAS. D-E. Also that the Respondent did not go to sleep as they immediately filed this case 5 days after the striking out of the first case.\\n\\nIt is submitted that the Appellant was duly served with the accompanying\\n\\n15\\n affidavit to the writ as shown by the records and where this is not the case; the party contesting ought to swear to an affidavit of rebuttal. He relied on AINA V. OBAIOLORUNKOSI (1986) 2 NWLR (PT.22) PAGE 316 AT 322 PARAS C-G.&nbsp;On breach of fair hearing, it is submitted that a party who refuses to take advantage of the fair hearing process cannot turn around and accuse the Court of denying him fair hearing. It is contended that the Appellant was aware of the case against him, yet did not file a conditional appearance to challenge the writ nor did he file a notice of intention to defend the suit. He cited&nbsp;DANTATA V MOHAMMED (2012) 8 NWLR (pt. 1302) PAGE 366 AT 381 PARAS. A-C. Assuming but not conceding that there was no accompanying affidavit, it is a mistake of the bailiff and cannot vitiate the proceedings of the lower Court. He relied on FAMFA OIL LTD v. A.G FED (2003) 18 NWLR (PT.852) 453 AT 471 PARAS F-G. Learned Counsel has submitted that the Appellant had admitted in paragraph 4 of his further affidavit to his motion dated 14/4/2011 that the Appellant was served with all the processes. Also, that there is presumption of regularity in favour of the\\n\\n16\\n Respondent pursuant to Section 168 (1) of the Evidence Act, 2011 and NADABO v. DUBAI (2011) 7 NWLR (Pt.1245) PG. 155 AT 179 PARAS. E-F.\\n\\nOn the illegality of service on the Appellant, it is submitted that service was not done in the Appellant in his personal capacity as Mr Babington-Ashaye but in his capacity as Receiver to the corporate entity known as Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. That within the period a company is in receivership, the Receiver is the one in charge of the company. He cited DAGAZAU v. BOKIR INTERNATIONAL CO. LTD. (2011) 14 NWLR (PT. 1267) PG. 261 AT 325. He maintained that service on a company is different from service on a corporate body. He in support relied on CASH AFFAIRS FINANCE LTD. V INLAND BANK (NIG) PLC (2000) 1 NWLR (PT.658) PG. 685. Again, that the Appellant had the opportunity to have objected to this at the trial stage. He cited the Supreme Court authority in EZOMO v. OYAKHIRE (1985) 1 NWLR (PT.2) PG. 195 AT 201-203. Similarly, that defect in service is a mere irregularity. He relied on ADEGOKE MOTORS v. ADESANYA (1989) 3 NWLR (PT.109) 250 AT 265, PARAS B-C. He prayed this Court to dismiss the appeal and uphold the\\n\\n17\\n decision of the Katsina State High Court, Funtua.\\n\\nA Reply Brief is not for a second bite at the cherry. Indeed, I see no new issues in the argument of the Respondent that should necessitate a Reply from the Appellant's learned Counsel. A Reply brief is not for re-argument, rejoinder or adumbration of issues but for addressing new issues raised in the Respondent's brief, if any. See RAYMOND D. OGOLO V PAUL D. FUBARA (2003) 5 SC 141 AT 156, (2003) FWLR (PT.169) 1285 AT 1308 SC, NITEL PLC V OCHOLI (2001) FWLR (PT.74) 254 AT 267. Therefore, there is no merit to consider the Reply brief of the Appellant.\\n\\nAs a general rule, a Receiver cannot sue or be sued in his own name as receiver since he has no property vested in him, and so acquires no right of action by his appointment. See RE: ADETONA (1994) 3 NWLR (PT. 333) 481 AT 489 H. It is in this instance that the Receiver ought not to sue in his own name but against \\\"Stirling Engineering Nigeria Limited (sued by its Receiver/Manager Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye)\\\". However, general laws have never been without exceptions. This was stated in the case of RE: ADETONA (1994) 3 NWLR (PT. 333) 491\\n\\n18\\n AT 490 PARA C, when it was held thus:\\n\\\"As a general rule a receiver as such, is not entitled to bring an action in his own name as receiver. This is because no property is automatically vested in him by his appointment. But he may acquire a right to sue in his own name arising out of his receivership, but not in consequence of it alone.\\\"\\nIn the present appeal however, it is notable that the property was vested in the Receiver who was sued because he refused to pay up the debt owed to the Respondent by Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. It was the Receiver who was vested with the right over the property to advertise same in Guardian Newspaper of 21/2/2005, hence holding himself out as the person responsible for discharging the liabilities of Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. Appurtenant to this was the decision of this Court per PEMU, J.C.A. in FREDRIKO V PETROLEUM SERVICES COMPANY LTD v. FBN PLC &amp; ANOR (2014) LPELR-22538(CA), wherein it held:\\n\\\"No company has any locus standi to sue where it has already entered receivership. It is the Receiver/Manager, who, by operation of law, should sue on behalf of the Company. Indeed the powers of\\n\\n19\\n the Directors of the Company became paralyzed because of the appointment of the Receiver/Manager. The Assets of the Company remain with the Receiver/Manager and he alone has the right to deal with these assets as long as he remains the Receiver Manager. The rights to deal with the assets inherent in the receivership can only be revived at the end and/or termination of the Receivership.\\\"\\nIn the same light, it is on record that the Appellant held out MR BABATUNDE AJAYI or as he was MR ADE A. BABINGTON-ASHAYE as the Agent and Receiver of Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. when it variously responded&nbsp;to the suits and application of the Respondent without protest to the fact that the suit ought to have been instituted against \\\"Stirling Engineering Nigeria Limited (sued by its Receiver/Manager Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye)\\\" and not the other way round. At pages 55- 59 of the records, when the Appellant filed its motion on notice wherein it sought that the judgment of the trial Court be set aside, it never out of the 9 Grounds objected or protested that the suit ought to have been instituted against \\\"Stirling Engineering Nigeria Limited (sued by its\\n\\n20\\n Receiver/Manager MR ADE A. BABINGTON-ASHAYE)\\\" save that it protested under Ground 4 that the leave of the trial Court was not obtained to institute the action against the defendant as the Receiver/Manager of Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. Again, in its Further Affidavit at pages 115-116, no such protest was made. It is also on record that the Appellant after the demise of MR ADE A. BABINGTON ASHAYE and during the pendency of this appeal applied and substituted same with MR BABATUNDE AJAYI/Receiver/Manager of Stirling Civil Engineering Nig. Ltd without any effort to have the proper Appellant or Defendant as it was before the Court. MR ADE A. BABINGTON-ASHAYE was then an agent of Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd for the purpose of liquidating the debts of the Respondent. Thus, the agent normally binds not himself but his principal by the contracts he makes. See GLOBAL SOAP AND DETERGENT IND. LTD. &amp; ORS. V BELLO &amp; ANOR. (2011) LPELR-9092(CA).\\n\\nSimilarly, where the mistake is as to name, the application can be brought to Court to amend by substituting the name with the one known in law. In such a case, it is only a misnomer which is the case in this\\n\\n21\\n appeal.&nbsp;Where therefore a party has been misjoined, the Court may at any stage of the proceedings order that the name of any party improperly joined, whether as plaintiff or defendant, be struck out or amended. This is on the application of the party that is interested and is to be affected. The Appellant had this burden on him but failed woefully to do that only now to be crying foul. This is unacceptable in law. It has been held that no cause or matter shall be defeated by reason of the misjoinder or non-joinder of parties as the Court may in every cause or matter deal with the matter in controversy so far as regards the rights and interest of the parties actually before it. See OSONDU v. SOLEL BONEH (NIG) LTD (2000) 3 SC 429 AT 461, BABAYEJU V ASHAMU (1998) 9 NWLR (PT.567) 546. Where there is no complaint against a party, the non-joinder of that party will not affect the proper determination of the issues joined. See DANTSOHO v. MOHAMMED (2003) 2 SC 42 AT 55.\\n\\nIt is foremost to note that in determining the limitation period, it is advisable to look at the processes filed by the Claimant herein the Respondent. See MIL. ADMIN., EKITI STATE v. ALADEYELU\\n\\n22\\n (2007) 14 NWLR (PT.1055) 619, WOHEREM V EMEREUWA (2004) 6-7 S.C. 161; (2004) 13 NWLR (PT. 890) 398 AT 417. By the pleadings of the Respondent particularly their affidavit in support dated 15/12/2010 and the annexures contained at pages 1-38, they asserted especially from paragraphs 16-21 that the Respondent's cause of action was renewed by the admission of the debt by Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. The company equally did not contest the debt but wrote severally to confirm the balance from the Respondent as shown in the Exhibits at pages 31-33 of the records. Similarly, the company sent an undertaking to UBA Plc. to domicile payments for the subcontract.\\nUpon all the foregoing, the Appellant now wants to hide under the guise of statute of limitation to unscrupulously and unjustly enrich itself with the gain of N22,466,200.50 owed the Respondent which the company had blatantly refused to pay. In S.P.D.C.N v. EJEBU (2011) 17 NWLR (PT.1276) 324 AT 942 PARAS D-E, it was held thus: \\n\\\"It is also settled law that generally negotiation by the parties does not prevent or stop the period of limitation stipulated by a statute from running. This however is\\n\\n23\\n subject to qualification that where there has been admission of liability during negotiation and all that is remaining is fulfillment of the agreement it cannot be just and equitable that the action would be barred after the statutory period of limitation giving rise to the action if the defendant were to resile from the agreement during negotiation...From the following it is pre-supposed that \\n1. There was an admission of liability upon negotiation\\n2. Which produced an agreement binding on the parties, and not a mere offer,\\n3. And it will be inequitable for a party to be allowed to resile from the agreement reached during negotiation.\\\" \\nSee also NWADIARO v. SHELL PET. DEV. COY (1990) 5 NWLR (PT.150) 322 AT 338-339, SHELL PET. DEV. COY. V FARAH&nbsp;(1995) 3 NWLR (PT.382) 148 AT 156 RATIO 4. In OLAOGUN ENT. LTD V SAEBY JERNSTOBERI &amp; ANOR (1992) 4 NWLR (PT.235) 361, a case of claim of interest founded on contract which interest was said to be statute barred, it was held that an acknowledgement or promise to pay after limitation period must be very clear to raise any inference of acknowledgment or enforceable promise to pay the debt.\\n\\n24\\nBeing an action for recovery of debt, the period of limitation is 6 years and any action instituted after that is statute barred. See N.S.T.F.M.B. V KLIFCO NIG. LTD. (2010) 13 NWLR (PT.1211) 307 AT 329, OGOJA LOCAL GOVERNMENT V OFFOBOCHE (1996) 7 NWLR (PT. 458) 48 AT 92 PARAS G-H. Nevertheless, as deposed by the Respondent in paragraph 21 in the lower Court, the cause of action arose on 3/3/2005 whereas the case was instituted by the Respondent on 15/12/2010. Thus, its lifespan has not expired and is not caught up by the statute of limitation.\\n\\nOn the service of the writ on the Appellant without accompanying affidavit, the Appellant has submitted that it amounted to a breach of his right to fair hearing and therefore a nullity. It is not in dispute that the Appellant was not served a writ of summons but that it was not accompanied with an affidavit. In fact, there is proof or affidavit of service that the Appellant was so duly served. The object of a writ of summons was stated In SKENCONSULT (NIG.) LTD. &amp; ANOR. V UKEY (1981) 1 S.C. (REPRINT) 4, PER NNAMANI J.S.C. as follows:\\n\\\"Writ of summons includes any writ or process\\n\\n25\\n by which a suit is commenced or of which the object is to require the appearance of any person against whom relief is sought in a suit or who is interested in resisting such relief.\\\"\\nThe object of a writ is for the appearance of the other party who is \\\"commanded\\\" to enter a defence or appear. Furthermore, the relief sought by the Respondent was clearly written on the writ at page 43 of the records to include:\\ni. The sum of N22,466,200.50 (Twenty Two Million, Four Hundred and Sixty Thousand, Two Hundred Naira, Fifty Kobo) being the balance payment due to the plaintiff for carrying out sub-contract work of stone-pitching of water drainage in Funtua town of Katsina State for Sterling Civil Engineering Company Limited. \\nii. Interest on the above sum at the rate of 21% per annum until the entire judgment sum is paid. \\niii. Cost of action.\\nIn the light of the above, the Appellant who was commanded to enter his defence within 30 days or have judgment entered against him slept after clearly admitting at page 115 in paragraph 4 that he was served through Ebere Nge by one Abdullahi Tambai on 22/12/2010 and is on record that he was\\n\\n26\\n served, now turns around to complain that he was denied the right to fair hearing. Fair hearing implies hearing the parties or giving them the opportunity to be heard. See OKIKE v. LPDC &amp; ORS (2005) LPELR-7466(CA). In INEC v MUSA (2003) 3 NWLR (PT. 806) 72, the apex Court held that:\\n\\\"Fair hearing in essence means giving equal opportunity to the parties to be heard in the litigation before the Court where parties are given opportunity to be heard, they cannot complain of breach of fair hearing principles.\\\"\\nI think this is one of the most preposterous defence on fair hearing to be made. I cannot see where the non-accompaniment of affidavit can deny the Appellant the right to fair hearing. What strake of effort did he make to show the Court that the non-accompaniment of affidavit affected the service or amounted to non-service? If the Appellant was not duly served with the accompanying affidavit to the writ; the party contesting ought to swear to an affidavit of rebuttal. See AINA V.&nbsp;OBAIOLORUNKOSI (1936) 2 NWLR (PT.22) PAGE 316 AT 322 PARAS C-G.&nbsp;Does non-accompaniment of affidavit to writ of summons amount to non-service which robs the\\n\\n27\\nCourt its jurisdiction? Per GUMEL, J.C.A. in BELLO v. OHIKHUEME &amp; ORS (2014) LPELR-24412(CA) reasoned that the object of the service is to give notice to the defendant, so that he may be aware of, and be able to resist, if he may, that which is sought against him, because without that service, he may not know that the plaintiff has sued him before a particular Court. The Appellant has at most taken the order of Court on him for granted and has consequently waived every right available to him when he did not as commanded file any notice of intention to defend and allowed judgment to be entered against him for non-appearance according to the law. This Court has occasion to tersely state as follows Per PETER-ODILI, J.C.A in CBN V DINNEH (2005) LPELR-11849(CA):\\n\\\"Where limitation of action is related to torts and contract, it is an accepted principle that the statute of limitation is a defence which can be waived.\\\"\\n\\nCoupled with the issue that he was not personally served, there is already a presumption of service and regularity against the Appellant by his admission that \\\"I was informed by Ebere Nge on 15th February 2011 at\\n\\n28\\n 1:15pm in our office and I verily believe her that the bailiff of this Court namely Abdullahi Tambai on 22nd December 2010 served her with only writ without any accompanying affidavit...\\\" It was again conceded by the Appellant in paragraph 4.5 at page 6 of his brief that \\\"a receiver must be sued in the name and on behalf of the company.\\\" If that is the case as rightly submitted by the Appellant, why should he now expect personal service to be effected on him? It is the law that service on a company is on any director, secretary or other principal officer of the company. See Section 78 of CAMA, CASH AFFAIRS FINANCE LTD. v. INLAND BANK (NIG) PLC (2000) 1 NWLR (PT.658) 685. Indeed, the Appellant did not argue the fact that Ebere Nge is not the Secretary of the Appellant but did accept that she was.It is pertinent to note that this appeal arose from the judgment of the trial Court on the merit under the undefended list procedure delivered on 14/2/2011 which the trial Court considered at page 54 as follows:&nbsp;\\\"Now, considering the Writ the affidavit in support, Exhibits 1-13 annexed along with the oral submissions of Mr. Ogon of Counsel\\n\\n29\\n to the Plaintiff, I hereby enter judgment in favour of the Plaintiff for the sum of N22,406,200:50K.\\\"\\nHaving established that the Appellant was served, his failure to file notice of intention to defend cannot save his him. In A.S.T.C. V QUORUM CONSORTIUM (2009) 9 NWLR (PT. 1145) 1 S.C., the Supreme Court on this held Per MUKHTAR, J.S.C:\\n\\\"Having found, rightly in my view, that the appellants did not enter appearance and did not file notice of intention to defend the respondent's claim, I am satisfied that the trial judge was entitled to enter judgment... as he did.\\\"\\n\\nIn all therefore, I resolve this issue against the Appellant. The judgment of the High Court of Katsina State holden at Funtua in Suit No.KTH/FT/135M/10, delivered on 14/2/2011 by Hon. Justice I.M. Bako, is hereby affirmed. Consequently, the appeal fails and it is hereby dismissed. I award a costs of N50,000.00 only in favour of the Respondent against the Appellant.ISAIAH OLUFEMI AKEJU, J.C.A.: I had the privilege of reading the judgment of my learned brother Uwani Musa Abba Aji JCA before it was delivered. I am in full\\n\\n\\n30\\n agreement with the reasoning of my learned brother, and the conclusion that the appeal lacks merit. I dismiss the appeal and abide by the consequential order.\\n\\nAMINA AUDI WAMBAI, J.C.A.: I have had the opportunity of reading in draft, the lead Judgment delivered by my learned brother, Uwani Musa Abba Aji, JCA who has considered all the issues raised in this appeal. I agree with the reasoning and conclusion therein that there is no merit in the appeal. It deserves to be dismissed. I too, dismiss the appeal.\\nI abide the consequential orders in the lead Judgment.\\n\\n31\\nAppearances:                                                      O.A.

Distilled from grounds 11 and 12.\\n\\nLearned Counsel to the Appellant answered issues 1 and 3 in the positive while answering issues 2, 4, and 5 in the negative. He submitted inter alia that the lower Tribunal did not properly evaluate the evidence adduced by the Appellants who were the petitioners in the lower Court. Counsel submitted that out of the 6 issues they formulated, the Tribunal only dealt with a single issue. Learned Counsel also submitted that the trial Tribunal came to a wrong conclusion on overvoting because it compared the total number of accredited voters with the total number of valid votes cast at the election\\n\\n2\\n instead of with the total number of votes cast valid or not. He relied on the following cases:\\nYAHAYA &amp; ANOR V DANKWAMBO &amp; ORS (2016) LPELR-48364 (SC) PGS 74-75; DANDAM &amp; ANOR V INEC &amp; ORS (2019) LPELR-49517 (CA)\\n\\nLearned counsel submitted further that the lower Tribunal failed to apply judicial authorities on the principle that documents speak for themselves. Learned counsel also submitted that the evidence of their 39 witnesses spoke to the documents and so the Tribunal was wrong to have held that the documents were dumped on it. Learned counsel also referred to the various documents tendered and submitted that the judicial authorities referred to by the Tribunal did not interpret Section 13 of the Electoral Act. Learned counsel faulted the reliance on the case of OYETOLA V INEC stating that the interpretation given to same was faulty and that no regard was given to the facts of this case. He relied on the case of NURUDEEN V OYETOLA &amp; ORS (2023) LPELR-60093 (CA) and submitted that the heavy burden of proving noncompliance has been reduced by Section 137 of the Evidence Act.\\n\\n\\u200bLearned Counsel then proceeded to attempt to tie up\\n\\n3\\n the evidence of the various witnesses with the documents tendered at the Tribunal. He submitted that even without oral evidence, the exhibits tendered proved overvoting as oral evidence cannot alter documentary evidence. Learned counsel also submitted that the Tribunal did not scrutinize all the documents tendered but only referred to a few. He submitted further that the Tribunal did not consider the evidence of the non-polling unit agents e.g., the collation agents, supervisors etc and that this position was perverse.\\n\\nCounsel submitted that the Court ought to have found that there was overvoting and should have nullified the election. He relied on the case of APC &amp; ORS V KARFI &amp; ORS (2015) LPELR-41857 (CA) 21-22 para-D. He submitted that the Respondents who asserted the positive had the duty to prove that there was accreditation and that it was done in accordance with the law and election manual. He relied on the cases of:\\nTERAB V LAWAN (1992) 3 NWLR (PT 231) 569 @ 588 and FAYEMI V ONI (2009) 7 NWLR (PT1140) 223 @ 285; AWUSE V ODILI &amp; ORS (2005)16 NWLR (PT 925) 416\\n\\n\\u200bOn the issue of rejection of some CTCs for nonpayment for the\\n\\n4\\n certification, learned counsel to the Appellants submitted that there was payment for certification and referred to exhibit 176 as well as some remitta reference receipts which were never tendered before the Tribunal and so were not part of the record of the trial Tribunal. Counsel also relied on the case of NURUDEEN V OYETOLA &amp; ORS (supra) and submitted further that the fact that the certification did not appear on the documents did not mean they were not certified. He relied on BAYAWO V NDLEA &amp; ORS (2018) LPELR-45030 (CA). He submitted that even where the certification was not paid for, the lower Court should have ordered that payment be made. He relied on the cases of TABIK INV LTD &amp; ANOR V GTB (2011) LPELR-3131 (SC) and UDO V STATE (2016) LPELR- 40721 (SC). Counsel finally urged this Court to invoke its powers under Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act to verify the proof of payment, and find that Section 104 of the Evidence Act was complied with and proceed to admit the documents in evidence.\\n\\n\\u200bOn issue 5, counsel submitted that the Tribunal's finding that the entry of the results on form EC8B(ii) means the results were reckoned with was\\n\\n5\\n wrong because according to him, this confirmed that the results had been cancelled. He submitted that the Tribunal should have considered the above together with other exhibits tendered to apply the margin of lead principle. On this counsel referred to the evidence of PW3 and exhibits P149-P160. He urged this Court to allow the appeal.\\n\\nOpposing the appeal, learned counsel to the 1st Respondent presented the following issues for determination:\\n1. Whether the trial tribunal was not right when it refused to accord probative value to the documents tendered by the Appellants and admitted for lack of evidence of payment? Distilled from grounds land 2 of the notice of appeal.\\n2. Whether the Honourable trial tribunal properly evaluated the petition as well as the evidence of the appellants in making its findings? Distilled from grounds 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 23 of the notice of appeal.\\n3. Whether the trial tribunal was right in refusing to apply the margin of lead principle in the circumstances of the petition as well as the evidence before it? Distilled from grounds&nbsp;11 and 12 of the notice of appeal.\\n4. Whether the Honourable trial\\n\\n6\\n tribunal was right in treating the evidence of PW1, PW2, PW3, PW21, PW36 and PW40 as hearsay? Distilled from ground 8 of the notice of appeal.\\n5. Whether the trial tribunal was right when it held that the Appellants failed to discharge the burden of proof as required by law to be entitled to the reliefs sought before the trial tribunal? Distilled from grounds 13 and 14 of the notice of appeal.\\n\\nLearned counsel answered issue 1 in the positive while submitting that the Appellants had a duty to show that the certification was done in accordance with the law and relied on the case of MOMODU V IBRAHIM (2021) LPELR-54137 (CA). Learned counsel submitted that the Appellant's counsel who alluded to payment for the certification did not refer to the exhibit which showed the alleged payment or even the date or receipt number. He denied the argument of the Appellant's counsel that the 1st Respondent did not deny the payment for the certification by referring to the records where the said 1st Respondent denied that payment was made for the certification. On some Remita receipts mentioned in the argument, learned counsel submitted that no such exhibits were ever\\n\\n7\\n produced or tendered before the Tribunal and no evidence was given about them and they cannot therefore be produced at the appeal stage. He urged this Court to discountenance with the Remita receipts mentioned in the submissions of the learned Appellant's counsel.\\n\\nOn issues 2 and 5, learned counsel referred to the records where the Tribunal evaluated the evidence adduced at the tribunal and submitted that the said Tribunal properly evaluated the evidence and came to the correct finding. He submitted that the finding that the evidence of the non-polling agent witnesses who said they were informed by the polling agents amounted to hearsay was not challenged. Counsel referred to many findings of fact that were not challenged in this appeal and submitted that they are in the circumstance binding on the authority of IME DAVID IDIOK V STATE (2008) LPELR-1423 (SC).\\n\\n\\u200bLearned counsel also referred to the pages in the records where the lower Court analysed the documents tendered and declared some to be inadmissible in evidence. Learned counsel submitted that the voters registers were merely dumped on the Tribunal without the witnesses speaking to them and the\\n\\n8\\n Tribunal made a proper finding to that effect. On alterations, counsel submitted that no second set of results were tendered to prove alterations of the results. Counsel stated that the witnesses said they had their duplicate copies of the results of the polling units mentioned but failed to produce them raising the presumption that if they were tendered, they would have been against the Appellants. Counsel relied on Section 167 (d) of the Evidence Act and the case of APC &amp; ORS V INEC &amp; ORS (2014) LPELR-24036 (SC) Learned counsel also stated that in any case, the witnesses admitted that all the corrections were initialled.\\n\\nLearned counsel submitted that the Appellants who alleged overvoting did not state the number of votes affected by the said acts and how it affected the results thereby making the allegation speculative.\\n\\nOn the implication of Section 137 of the Electoral Act, learned counsel referred this Court to the case of PDP V OYETOLA &amp; 3 ORS (2023) LPELR-60291 (CA) and submitted that the burden of proving the petition was still on the Petitioner since the reliefs sought were declaratory in nature.\\n\\n\\u200bOn issue 3. Learned counsel\\n\\n9\\n submitted that the Appellants did not show that the number of registered voters in the areas where the results were cancelled were more than the margin of lead and that the tabulation in the petition was the product of inadmissible evidence. Counsel also referred to the evidence of PW5 where he admitted after going through all the documents that the votes from cancelled polling units were not collated,\\n\\nOn issue 4, learned counsel submitted that the Tribunal was right when it treated the evidence of those who said they were informed by others as hearsay. He relied on the case of GUNDIRI V NYAKO (supra). He urged this Court to dismiss this appeal.\\n\\nOn his part, learned counsel to the 2nd Respondent raised a preliminary objection on the following grounds:\\n1. The appeal is academic as critical findings of the trial Tribunal were not challenged.\\n2. This Honourable Court lacks the judicial competence to entertain this appeal with finality on the ground that the 2nd Respondent was not personally served with the Appellant's Notice of appeal and the Record of appeal.\\n3. This Honourable Court lacks the judicial competence to entertain this appeal\\n\\n10\\n and to determine same with finality on the ground that the record of appeal upon which this appeal is predicated is incomplete.\\n4. Ground One and Two of the notice of appeal is incompetent same not being supported by the record of appeal.\\n5. Ground one and two of the notice of appeal argued in issue of the brief of argument is incompetent same not being supported by Record of Appeal.\\n6. This Honourable Court lacks the judicial competence to entertain this appeal same being academic on the grounds that the reliefs sought by the Appellant are not grantable.\\n7. The evidence of payment introduced by the Appellants cannot be accommodated in this appeal same not being part of the evidence adduced at the trial Court, same is not borne out of the record of appeal.\\n\\n\\u200bArguing the first ground, learned counsel submitted that substantial findings of fact made by the Tribunal were not challenged and so the appeal is merely academic. On ground 2, learned counsel submitted that the 2nd Respondent was not personally served with the notice and records of appeal and so the appeal was incompetent, he relied on the case of ODEY V ALAGA (2021) 13 NWLR\\n\\n11\\n (PT. 1792) 1 @ 9; UMOH V EKPO (2018) LPELR-45879 (CA); and NBN NIG LTD V GUTHRIE NIG LTD (1993) 4 SCNJ 17.\\n\\nOn ground 3, counsel submitted that the reference to some receipts in ground 1 of the grounds of appeal showed that the records were incomplete since there are no such receipts in the records. He submitted that in the absence of complete records, the appeal is incompetent. He relied on the cases of GARUBA &amp; ORS V OMOKHODION &amp; ORS (2011) LPELR-1309 and DAGEMA LGC V BRAIDE &amp; ORS (2017) LPELR-49238 (CA) PGS 16-20.\\n\\nOn ground 4, counsel submitted that grounds 1 and 2 of the grounds of appeal were not borne out by the records of the Tribunal and so are incompetent. He relied on the case of AJAYI V AJAYI (2014) LPELR- 22471 (CA).\\n\\nOn ground 5, Counsel submitted that the reliefs sought in this appeal are not grantable because if this Court allows the appeal and revisits the evidence before the Court, it would be doing so outside the 180 days allowed by law and so the life of the petition has been extinguished by the efflux of time. He relied on the case of OSEMEIKHIAN V EDIONWELE (2016) LPELR-40499 (CA)\\n\\n\\u200bOn ground 6, learned counsel\\n\\n12\\n submitted that the introduction of remita receipts which is new evidence was improper without leave of Court and ought to be discountenanced. He relied on the case of MUHAMMAD V STATE (2017) LPELR-42098 (SC)\\n\\n\\u200bOn the main appeal, learned counsel raised similar issues and made similar submissions as learned counsel to the 1st Respondent. The 2nd Respondent formulated the following issues for determination: -\\n1. Whether the trial tribunal was right when it refused to accord credence and probative value to the documents tendered by the Appellants and admitted for lack of evidence of payment? (Distilled from grounds One and Two).\\n2. Whether the Honourable trial tribunal properly evaluated the petition as well as the evidence of the appellants in making its findings (Distilled from grounds Three, Six, Seven, Nine, Ten, Fifteen, Sixteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, Nineteen, Twenty, Twenty- one and Twenty-Three).\\n3. Whether the trial tribunal was right in refusing to apply the margin of lead principle in the circumstances of the petition as well as the evidence before it? Distilled from grounds 11 and 12.\\n4. Whether the Honourable trial tribunal was\\n\\n13\\n right in treating the evidence of PW1, PW2, PW3, PW21, PW36 and PW40 as hearsay? (Distilled from ground Eight).\\n5. Whether the trial tribunal was right when it held that the Appellants failed to discharge the burden of proof as required by law to be entitled to the reliefs sought before the trial tribunal? (Distilled from grounds Thirteen and Fourteen).\\n\\nLearned counsel answered all the issues formulated by him in the affirmative.\\n\\nHe urged the Court to either dismiss the appeal for being academic or strike out the offending grounds and dismiss the appeal on the merits. \\n\\nOpposing the appeal, learned counsel to the 3rd Respondent raised a preliminary point that no issue for determination was formulated on grounds 4, 6, 8, 17, 18, and 22 of the grounds of appeal and urged this Court to strike them out as having been abandoned. He relied on the case of ZANGO V SIGHT &amp; SOUND COMMUNICATIONS LTD (2018) LPELR-45047 (CA) PG 30.\\n\\n\\u200bLearned counsel raised the following issues for determination:\\n1. Whether or not the trial Tribunal actually relied on the total valid votes instead to the total votes cast in the determination of the over-voting (Relates\\n\\n14\\n to Ground 7)\\n2. Whether the Appellants proved their case to be entitled to judgment. (Relates to ground 23).\\n3. Whether or not the Appellants could rightly seek to introduce through its ground of appeal purported evidence of payment for Certified True Copies of documents not adduced before the trial Tribunal (Relates to Ground 1 of appeal).\\n4. Whether or not in the absence of proof or receipt of payment of fees for certification of public documents, the trial Tribunal rightly held the certified copies of the said documents as inadmissible in evidence (Relates to Ground 2 of appeal)\\n5. Whether or not in the absence of credible and admissible evidence as found by the tribunal, it can be said that the Appellants proved cancellation of result and the margin of lead (Relates to grounds 11 and 12 of appeal)\\n\\nOn whether the Tribunal evaluated the evidence adduced, learned counsel referred to the relevant pages and submitted that the Tribunal considered the evidence presented and properly evaluated same.\\n\\n\\u200bLearned counsel catalogued several findings of fact that were not challenged on the appeal and submitted that they are deemed accepted\\n\\n15\\n and are therefore final and binding.\\n\\nOn the rejection of the certified true copies of the forms EC8A (ii) and other documents, learned counsel submitted that there was no payment for the certification and that exhibit P176 the receipt of N140 was clearly said to be for PVC collection CTC. Learned counsel urged this Court not to accept the new evidence the Appellants seek to present as no leave of Court was sought for their inclusion and also the Appellants throughout the case at the Tribunal did not mention the said receipts. He relied on the cases of MADUKOLU V. NKEMDILIM (1962) 1 ALL NLR 587@ 594 and UDOM V. UMANA (2016) 12 NWLR (PT 1626) PG179 @ 234-235.\\n\\nLearned counsel also submitted that the finding of fact on the documents being documentary hearsay was never appealed against. Counsel urged this Court to dismiss the appeal.\\n\\nThe Appellants' counsel filed responses to the Respondents' briefs and answered the issues raised in the preliminary objections.\\n\\nHaving considered all the submissions of learned counsel as well as the record of appeal and exhibits, I shall consider the preliminary objections first.\\n\\n\\u200bOn whether this appeal is a\\n\\n16\\nmere academic exercise, I have looked at the entire grounds of appeal and issues formulated and I see that the Appellants are among other grounds complaining about the decision being against the weight of evidence. See ground 23. I agree with learned counsel to the Appellants that this ground calls for some re-evaluation of the evidence adduced and findings of the lower Court. See the cases of ANYA V ANYA &amp; ORS (2014) LPELR-22479 (CA) and KEYSTONE BANK V OYEWALE (2014) LPELR -23612 (CA).\\n\\nOn lack of personal service on the 2nd Respondent, by Order 2 Rules 1 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Rules, service of processes on a Respondent could be either by personal service or by electronic means and besides, the rules provide that where the Court is satisfied that the notice of appeal has been communicated to the Respondent, no objection can be sustained on this ground. In the present case, the 2nd Respondent was aware of the appeal and properly responded to all the issues raised therein. In the circumstance, this ground of objection cannot be sustained. See ABDULLAHI V LOKO &amp; ORS (2022) LPELR-56704 (CA).\\n\\n\\u200bOn whether or not the records of appeal are\\n17\\n complete, learned counsel to the 2nd Respondent contradicted himself in grounds 3, 4 and 7 of his preliminary objection when on the one hand he complained that the records were incomplete and on the other hand stated that they are and that the remita payment receipts sought to be introduced at the appeal stage were never part of the records in the first place. I have seen the records of appeal and I fail to see where it is incomplete and the law allows any party to file the complete records. The authorities of GARUBA &amp; ORS V OMOKHODION &amp; ORS (SUPRA) and DEGEMA LGC V BRAIDE &amp; ORS (SUPRA) are clearly inapplicable to the facts of this case. The preliminary objection is not sustained on this ground.\\n\\nOn whether the reliefs sought in this appeal are grantable in view of the expiry of the 180 days given to the lower Tribunal to finish its case, I would say the reliefs are grantable. This is because it is well within the powers of the Court of Appeal under Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act to, in appropriate cases, re-evaluate the evidence of the lower Court provided it does so within the 60 days given to it after the judgment of the Tribunal by\\n\\n18\\n virtue of the Electoral Act. The Appellants are not asking for an order for a retrial or any order that seeks to reopen the case at the trial Court. In the circumstance, this ground of objection has no merit and is accordingly overruled.\\n\\nOn the abandoned grounds 4, 6, 8, 17, 18, and 22 raised by learned counsel to the 3rd Respondent, it is clear that these grounds were abandoned. Learned counsel to the Appellants has indirectly conceded to this fact when he submitted that they are surplusage. In the circumstance, the said grounds are accordingly struck out. This however does not in any way affect the appeal since there are several other grounds and issues raised that can be considered.\\nOn the whole, the preliminary objection is overruled.\\n\\nBefore going into the main appeal, the Appellants have filed an affidavit seeking to have some receipts to be part of the records of this Court while the Respondents have all filed counter affidavits. There was no motion filed by the Appellants upon which the affidavit is hinged. In the case of PATNASONIC NIG LTD V KABARA TRADING CO LTD &amp; ORS (2021) LPELR-55555 (CA), this Court held per Olabode Adegbehingbe\\n\\n19\\n JCA that an affidavit alone without a motion cannot correct a record of appeal. In the circumstance, the affidavit is incompetent and is accordingly struck out and so are all the counter affidavits along with it.\\n\\nOn the main appeal, the Appellants are complaining firstly that the Tribunal failed to consider all the issues for determination submitted to it by them. The law is trite that the Court is not bound to follow the issues as formulated by learned counsel provided the issues formulated by the Court captures the live issues in the case. In other words, the Court may rephrase the issues or even compacted in fewer issues or even in one issue as the Tribunal did in the present case. The important thing is that the Court must deal with any sub-issue or matter that calls for its determination. The Appellants did not specify which aspect of its six issues the Tribunal failed to consider under the one issue for determination framed by it and how that failure occasioned a miscarriage of justice. I therefore see no defect in the issue for determination formulated by the Tribunal because it encompassed the issues in the case and the Tribunal in answering the\\n\\n20\\n issue touched on the sub-issues raised by the Appellants. On the evaluation of evidence, I note that the Appellant's counsel argued issues 1, 2, and 3 together. Indeed, they are so closely related that they could have been subsumed in the first issue. I have also seen the argument on issue 5 and this is also closely related to issues 1, 2, and 3. In the circumstance, I shall consider issues 1, 2, 3 and 5 together and issue 4 separately.\\n\\nIt is indeed the law that a lower Court must pronounce on all issues raised in the matter before it. See OKPALA &amp; SONS LTD V NB PLC (SUPRA). I have seen that the lower Court considered and pronounced on the issue of over-voting, cancellation of results, documents presented, credibility of witnesses etc.\\n\\n\\u200bLooking at the evaluation of the evidence by the trial Tribunal as shown at pages 1196 to 1208 of the records, it is clear that the said Tribunal painstakingly considered all the evidence produced before it including the documentary evidence and arrived at the correct conclusion that the Appellants had not proved their petition. The Tribunal properly in my view considered the evidence adduced by the collation officers,\\n\\n21\\n polling agents and supervisors and made appropriate findings of fact. Learned counsel to the Appellants has given details and tried to tie the documentary evidence presented with the evidence of the witnesses. I am afraid the address time is not the time to explain the relevance of the documents tendered and how it ties with the case presented. It is the duty of the witnesses to speak to the documents tendered and not just mention them. The petitioners had a duty to present their case in such a way that the burden placed on them by law will be discharged. The witnesses are to show the alterations, cancellations etc in their respective polling stations and how many votes were affected etc. It is not for the Court to go back to chambers and begin to calculate and by itself give figures affected if it finds that there are illegal alterations. The Petitioners must make their own calculations and present to the Court while the Respondents will also be able to cross-examine the witnesses and also state which of the calculations they disagree with. It is only when this is done that the Court will now go back and compare the contesting positions and safely do its own\\n\\n22\\n calculations. It is not the duty of the Court to make out a case for a party, the party must do so itself. This Court earlier held in the case of&nbsp;PDP V. OYETOLA &amp; 3 ORS (2023) LPELR-60291 (CA) thus:\\n\\\"...in other words, the documentary evidence tendered remain dormant and were just dumped on the Tribunal. In my respected view, it remains settled position of the law that documentary evidence relied upon by a party must be specifically\\u200b linked to the aspect of his case to which it relates. A party cannot dump a bundle of documentary evidence on a Court or tribunal and expect the Court to conduct an independent enquiry to provide the link in the recess of its chambers. This would no doubt amount to a breach of the principle of fair hearing.\\\" See also UKEJE V UKEJE (2014) 11 NWLR PT.1418.\\n\\n\\u200bFurthermore, it is not even part of the counsel's duty to create a case for the party by presenting evidence at address stage. It is trite that an address no matter how well written cannot take the place of evidence. It is only to sum up evidence actually adduced by his clients and present the relevant case law applicable to the facts of the particular case.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"facts\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 199,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"This is an appeal against the Judgment of Hon. Justice A. O. Asenuga of the Ogun State High Court, Ota Division, Ogun State. \\nThe facts of the case are that on the 21st December, 2006, the Appellant, a labourer, went to his place of work. Prior to his leaving home, he had a sick child. While at work, he got a call from his wife that the sick child was running temperature and he had been taken to the hospital. The wife asked Appellant to come. On his way to the hospital at Akinade, he met OPC men who arrested him and asked for his residence and occupation which he supplied them. He was not allowed to contact his family members but was whisked away to the OPC farm. This was at about 5pm. On getting to the OPC farm, the Appellant met the Baba Bose who laughed at him and told him he had caught him at last. The Appellant was kept at the OPC farm till night and was taken to Sango Police Station and handed over to a police officer called Anthony. That was how the Appellant's ordeal began.\\nThe Brief of the Appellant dated 15/10/15 was filed on the same date. In his evidence on oath, the Appellant denied taking part in the robbery, that he was only arrested while on his way to the hospital to see his sick child. At the conclusion of the police investigation, the Appellant 1st and 3rd accused persons where charged before the trial Court with a three (3) count offence of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and armed robbery.\\nTrial commenced on 21st November, 2008 and the Appellant and other accused persons pleaded not guilty to the charges where upon the Respondent opened its case by calling five (5) witnesses as against the nine(9) listed in its proof of evidence. The Appellant gave evidence in his defence. He denied ever taking part in any armed robbery operation. He maintained that he was roped into the crime due to his defending his father's land from one Baba Bose, an OPC leader who wanted to take the land from his family. That he was induced to sign Ex. D and D1 after having his teeth removed by plier by one Ejembe. His mother gave evidence as DW4, corroborating appellant's story and was duly cross-examined. She confirmed the Appellant's alibi.\\nIn the course of PW4 tendering the extra-judicial statement, trial within trial was conducted as to the voluntariness of the statements but at the end of trial, the learned judge overruled the objection to the voluntariness of the statements and admitted them in evidence.&nbsp; The learned trial Judge after reviewing the evidence of parties convicted the Appellants of the offence of Conspiracy and Armed Robbery under the provisions of Section 6(b) and Punishable under Section 1(2)(a) of the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions Act (CAP R. II) Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004. They were each sentenced to death by hanging. \\nThe Appellant appealed to the Court of appeal seeking an order of discharge and acquittal against his conviction and sentence.\\n\",\n          \"This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court of Katsina State holden at Funtua in Suit No. KTH/FT/135M/10, delivered on 14/2/2011 by Hon. Justice I.M. Bako.\\n\\nThe Respondent commenced an action at the Federal High Court Katsina, against Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye under the undefended list procedure claiming the sum of Twenty Two Million, Four Hundred and Sixty-Six Thousand, Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50K) being the balance of payment due to the Respondent for carrying out sub-contract work of stone pitching of water drainage in Funtua town of Katsina State for Stirling Civil Engineering Nigeria Ltd. Judgment was entered in favour of the Respondent and the Appellant being dissatisfied appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal in appeal No. CA/K/201/2008 allowed the appeal in a judgment delivered on 15th December, 2010, on the ground that the Federal High Court, Katsina, lacked jurisdiction to entertain the action; hence the judgment was set aside and the suit struck out. Consequently, the Respondent filed a fresh action before the High Court of Katsina State in Suit No: KTH/FT/135M/2010 under the undefended list procedure.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Respondent obtained the leave of Court to serve the originating processes on the Appellant outside jurisdiction and the bailiff of the trial Court served the writ of summons and accompanying affidavit with the order of the Court granting leave to serve outside jurisdiction (which was obtained ex parte) on the Appellant's secretary, one Miss Ebere Nge of Babington Ashaye &amp; Co. The bailiff of the trial Court filed a proof of service of the originating processes on the Appellant and also delivered the processes to the Appellant's Counsel at his chambers but no step was taken to file any notice of intention to defend the action. On 14th February, 2011, when the matter came up for hearing, the Appellant was absent and unrepresented by Counsel and no notice of intention to defend the action was filed by the Appellant. However, during the course of the proceedings, just when the Court was about pronouncing its judgment, counsel to the Appellant, Mr. O.A. Orewale Esq. arrived in Court very late and the judge refused to record the counsel's appearance. Upon a careful consideration of the Writ, the affidavit in support and Exhibits annexed and the oral submissions of Counsel to the Respondent, the High Court proceeded to enter judgment in favour of the Respondent for the sum of Twenty Two Million Four Hundred and Sixty Six Thousand Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50k) together with interest at the rate of 21% per annum until the entire judgment sum is paid. Sequel to the decision of the High Court, the Appellant as judgment debtor filed a motion dated 14th February, 2011, at the High Court praying the Court to set aside its judgment, which the Respondent's Counsel vehemently opposed in a counter affidavit among other issues that the Court had become functus officio and should dismiss the application. After a careful consideration, the High Court dismissed the application for lacking in merit. While the appeal was pending, the initial Appellant, Mr. Babington Ashaye died and the Appellant's Counsel filed an application dated 8th February, 2013, praying for leave to substitute Mr. Babington Ashaye with Mr. Babatunde Ajayi, who is the new Receiver of Stirling Civil Engineering Ltd. The application was granted by this Honourable Court on the 18th of June, 2013, and the notice of appeal was amended and filed accordingly.\\n\\n\\n\\nDissatisfied with the said judgment, the Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.\",\n          \"This is an appeal against the decision of the National and State Houses of Assembly Election Petition Tribunal holden at Bauchi and delivered on the 11th September, 2023, wherein the Tribunal dismissed the petition of the Appellant.Dissatisfied with the decision of the trial Tribunal, the Appellants appealed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"issues\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 199,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The Court determined the appeal on the issues raised by the parties and couched as follows:\\nAPPELLANT'S ISSUES\\n1.

              "'GEORGE ADESOLA&nbsp;OGUNTADE, J.C.A. (Delivering the Leading Judgment): The appellant as Plaintiff before the Lagos High Court issued a specially indorsed writ of summons pursuant to Order 3 Rules 4 and 9 of the Lagos State Civil Procedure Rules claiming from the 1st and 2nd Respondents (as 1st and 2nd Defendants) the sum of N500,000 being credit facilities granted by the Plaintiff to the 1st Defendant. Interest and penalty were also claimed on the principal sum. In compliance with the rules, a Statement of Claim was filed along with the writ of summons.\\n\\nThe Plaintiff thereafter brought a motion ex-parte praying for an order:\\n\"Removing into the custody of this Honourable Court, the Peugeot 503 Saloon Car with Registration No. LA 1000R; the Volkswagen Jetta Saloon Car with Registration No. LA 556R and the Volkswagen Jetta Saloon Car with Registration No. LA 557R property of the 1st defendant pending the determination of the motion on Notice\"\\n\\nIn paragraphs 2(i), 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the affidavit in support of the motion it was deposed thus:\\n\"2(1) On or about the 15th day of June 1993 at the request of the 1st\\n1\\n Defendant, the Plaintiff, by its letter of the said date placed funds amounting to N500.000 (Five hundred thousand naira) with the 1st Defendant. A copy of the said letter is exhibited herewith and marked \"AMG 1\".\\n4. That I am aware that the 1st Defendant owns a Peugeot 505 Saloon Car. Registration No. LA 1000R; a Volkswagen Jetta Saloon Car Registration No. LA 556R; and a Volkswagen Jetta Saloon Car Registration No. LA 557R.\\n5. That the aforementioned cars are the only tangible assets of the 1st Defendant now remaining.\\n6. That both the 1st and 2nd Defendants are in grave financial difficulty whereupon they are likely in the immediate future to dispose of the cars in question without regard to the interests of the Plaintiff herein.\\n7. That the current value of the 3 (three) cars is not sufficient to meet the 1st Defendant\\'s outstandings to the Plaintiff.\\n8. That I honestly and reasonably believe that once the cars are disposed of by the defendant any judgment obtained by the Plaintiff against the said Defendants herein would be a mere barren judgment in that there would be no property of the said Defendant left\\n\\n   2 \\n upon which execution can be levied in satisfaction of any sum awarded.\"\\n \\n Several documentary exhibits were annexed to the affidavit in support of the motion ex-parte. The lower Court (Coram Thomas J) as he then was) on 4th October, 1994 granted the application pending the determination of the motion on Notice. The intervener/Respondent in this appeal later brought an application on notice seeking the following orders:\\n\"1. Leave for the applicant to intervene in this suit.\\n2. An order discharging the order of mareva injunction granted by this Court on 11 October, 1994 as it relates to the following vehicles:-\\ni. 505 Saloon Car with Registration No. LA 1000R\\nii. Volkswagen Jetta Saloon Car with Registration No. LA 556R.\\niii. Volkswagen Jetta Saloon Car with Registration No. LA 557R.\\n3. An order releasing the aforementioned vehicles to the applicant or in the alternative;\\n4. An order that the Plaintiff pay to the intervener the amount of money owed the intervener by the 1st Defendant.\"\\n \\n An affidavit was filed in support of the application. A further and better affidavit was later filed.\\n\\n3\\nThe Defendants in the suit deposed to a counter-affidavit. On 25/11/94, arguments were addressed to the lower Court in support and against the grant of the intervener\\'s motion. The lower Court on 13/1/95 granted the orders sought on the motion. Dissatisfied, the Plaintiff has brought this appeal before this Court on three grounds of appeal. In the appellant\\'s brief filed, the issues for determination were identified as the following.\\n\"1. On whom lies the burden of proof of due compliance with S.197 of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (Cap. 59). Laws of the Federation of Nigeria,&nbsp;1990. Or on the other hand who will fail if no evidence is adduced on either side.\\n2. Is the appellant a Creditor of the Company\"?\\n\\nThe Respondent formulated one issue for determination which is\"........\\n\"Whether the learned trial judge was right to have discharged the mareva injunction and ordered the release of the said vehicles to the intervener\".\\n\\nThe intervener Respondent in its briefs raised a preliminary objection as to the competency of the 1st and 2nd grounds of appeal. It was argued that this appeal being an interlocutory one\\n4\\n should have been brought with leave because the 1st &amp; 2nd grounds of appeal raised issues of mixed law and fact or fact.\\n Counsel relied on Nwadike v. Ibekwe (1987) 4 N.W.L.R. (Pt. 67) 71. The appellant on the other hand argued that the 1st and 2nd grounds of appeal were on law. The 1st and 2nd grounds of appeal read thus:\\n\"1. The learned trial judge erred in law when he held that it was the Plaintiff\\'s duty to prove that the intervener had not registered its \"chattel mortgage\" at the Corporate Affairs Commission in Compliance with S.197 of the Companies and Allied Matters Decree (Cap. 59), Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1990, thereby rendering the said Chattel Mortgage void against the liquidator of a Creditor.\\nPARTICULARS\\n(a) Success of the intervener\\'s application was by necessary implication arising from operation of law, premised upon the validity of the charge it obtained from the 1st Defendant in connection with the 3(three) motor vehicles forming the subject matter of the said application.\\nb. The combined effect of SS.197(1) and (2)(a) of the Companies and Allied Matters Decree (Cap.59), Laws of    5\\n the Federation of Nigeria, 1990 is to provide, inter alia, that unless the prescribed particulars of such a charge as is held by the Intervener herein, together with the instrument, if any, by which the said charge is created or evidenced, have been or are delivered to or received by the Commission for registration within ninety days of its creation, such charge becomes void against the liquidator and any creditor of the company.\\nc. The Intervener failed to prove any evidence whatsoever that it had complied with the requirements of S.197(1) of the Companies and Allied Matters Decrees, 1990 or that it was entitled to benefit from any of the exceptions or provisos to the operation of the said Section.\\nd. The learned trial judge failed to apply the elementary principle of law clearly set - out in the case of Moses Ola &amp; Sons v. Bank of the North Limited (1992) 3 NWLR (Pt. 229) 370 at 390 B -D. which was cited before him, and a long line of other similar cases, to the effect that in a Civil case, the burden of proof is on the party who substantially asserts the affirmative of an issue, and who must fail assuming no evidence was\\n\\n6\\n adduced on either side.\\n2. The learned trial judge erred in law when he held that the Plaintiff did not show that it is a Creditor or Liquidator.\\nPARTICULARS\\na. The fact that the Plaintiff is a Creditor of the 1st Defendant is elaborately deposed to in 2 (two) separate affidavits deposed to on 27th September, 1994 in the Suit herein.\\nb. It was on the basis of one of the said affidavit, deposed to in support of the Motion Ex- parte dated 27th September, 1994, that the learned trial judge granted the interim order for the removal of the cars into the Court\\'s custody.\\nc. By its Further Affidavit in support of the application deposed to Mon., 14th November, 1994, the Intervener exhibited the 2nd Defendant\\'s Counter Affidavit deposed to on 24th October, 1994 wherein it was clearly tacitly admitted in Paragraph 1 thereof that the Plaintiff is a Creditor of the 1st Defendant. \\nd. The learned trial judge was entitled to consider all documents filed in the Suit in arriving at a just decision on any matter arising therein. See Mhambe v. Shide (1994) 2 NWLR (Pt. 214) 210 and Oke v. Aiyedun (1986) 2\\n\\n7\\n NWLR (Pt. 23) 548.\\ne. The learned trial judge, having raised the question of the Plaintiff\\'s status as a creditor suo motu, he ought, to have in all the circumstances, directed the parties to address him thereupon.\\n\\nI have looked closely at the first ground of appeal. The complaint embodied in the ground is that upon a perusal of Section 197 of C.A.M.A. the lower Court should have concluded that the onus of showing compliance with Section 197 was upon the intervener/Respondent. The Court is not being invited to re-assess or re-evaluate the facts before the lower Court. The facts before the lower Court are not being disputed. In hearkening to the complaint of the appellant, all that I need to do is to interpret the provision of Section 197 of C.A.M.A. with a view to determining whether or not the intervener/Respondent bore the onus of showing that he had complied with Section 197 of C.A.M.A. It seems to me therefore that the 1st ground of appeal is a ground of law.\\n \\n The 2nd ground of appeal is a complaint that by stating that the Plaintiff did not show that it was a creditor or liquidator, the lower Court was in error. This\\n\\n8\\n complaint is an extension of the complaint in the 1st ground of appeal. Viewed against the background of this case, the second ground of appeal is in my view a ground of law. If a Court holds that a party has not called evidence to enable it decide a point in the case in the favour of the party, the Court does not thereby delve into the assessment or evaluation of evidence. In approaching the issue raised on the 2nd ground of appeal, my duty is to determine whether Section 197 imposes the duty on the Intervener respondent to show compliance with Section 197 of C.A.M.A and whether indeed the Intervener/respondent showed such compliance by calling the requisite evidence. This ground is a ground of law.\\n \\n I accordingly overrule the preliminary objection. I propose to consider the two issues together.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 197(1) of C.A.M.A. provides:\\n\"197(1) Subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, every charge created by a company being a charge to which this Section applies, shall so far as any security on the Company\\'s property or undertaking is conferred be void against the liquidator and any creditor of the company, unless the\\n\\n9\\n prescribed particulars of the charge together with the instrument if any, by which the charge is created or evidenced have been or are delivered to or received by the Commission for registration in the manner required by this Act within 90 days after the date of its creation but without prejudice to any contract or obligation for repayment of the money thereby secured. and when a charge becomes void under this Section, the money thereby secured shall immediately become payable.\"\\nThe appellant has not argued that the intervener/respondent did not register the mortgage in its favour to secure the loan it granted to the Defendants/Respondents. The argument of the appellant is that there was no evidence before the lower Court to show that the Chattel Mortgage in favour of the intervener/respondent was registered. Appellant\\'s counsel relying on Moses Ola &amp; Sons v. Bank of the North Ltd (1992) 3 N.W.L.R (Pt. 229) 370 submitted that the burden of proof was upon a party \"who substantially asserts the affirmature of an issue and who must fail assuming no evidence is adduced on either side.\"\\nUnderstood against the background of this case\\n\\n10\\n the submission of appellant\\'s counsel translates into this - \\'Since it was the intervener/respondent who brought an application to set aside the order of mareva injunction upon the ex-parte application of the Plaintiff, the intervener/respondent bore the evidential burden of showing that it had complied with the provisions of Section 197(1) of CAMA .\"\\n \\n The intervener/respondent\\'s counsel on the other hand argued that the Plaintiff being an unsecured creditor has no locus standi to complain of want of registration under Section 197(1) of CAMA. Counsel further submitted that even an unregistered charge is valid as between the mortgagor and the mortgagee. \\n Counsel submitted further that the success of the motion brought by the intervener depended on validity not registration. There was therefore no need for the intervener/respondent to show that the charge in its favour was registered.\\n \\n It is important that I first discuss the facts made available to the lower Court for the purpose of the application by the intervener/respondent that the mareva order made ex-parte be set aside. In paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, the affidavit in support of the\\n\\n11\\n application it was deposed thus:\\n\"3. That on or about the 23rd of January, 1992, the intervener granted the 1st defendant a loan of N500,000.00 and as security for its repayment the 1st defendant mortgaged to the intervener vehicles. The vehicles were seized by this Court at the instance of the Plaintiff. A copy of the Deed of Chattel mortgage as well as the accepted intervener\\'s offer letter is attached hereto as Exhibits A and B respectively.\\n4. Unfortunately, when the loan became repayable the 1st defendant could not perform. Consequently the intervener in accordance with Clause 7 of Exhibit A seized one of the mortgaged cars namely, Volkswagen Jetta Saloon with Registration No. LA 556R\\n5. The intervener further made strenuous unsuccessful efforts to seize the remaining two mortgaged cars but could not locate their whereabouts.\\n6. That while the aforementioned car was parted at the intervener\\'s premises at Plural House. Oyin Jolayemi Street, Victoria Island, Lagos, some officials of the Court accompanied by armed Policemen and Officers of the plaintiff came to our premises on October 11, 1994 and forcefully took away the\\n\\n12\\n vehicle.\\n7. That all attempts to get the entourage to appreciate the superiority of the intervener\\'s claim were unsuccessful.\\n8. That the three vehicles currently in the custody of the Court by virtue of an order of the Court actually belong to the applicant by virtue of an agreement dated January, 1992.\"\\n \\n There were annexed to the affidavit as exhibits some documents to show that the defendants/respondents took a loan of N500.000.00 from intervener/respondent. In particular, there was exhibited the mortgage agreement entered into between the defendants/respondents and the intervener/respondents. \\n \\n The intervener/respondent later filed a further and better affidavit. In paragraph 2 thereof, he deposed:\\n\"Further to paragraphs 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the affidavit in support of the motion of the intervener; the intervener had long before the order of mareva injunction exercised its power under the mortgage as buttressed by the attached counter-affidavit sworn to by the second defendant and marked Exhibit C. It is important that I set out the contents of the counter-affidavit deposed to by the 2nd defendant and attached to\\n\\n13\\n the counter-affidavit as Exhibit \\'C\\'. It reads;\\n\"1. The 1st defendant is not indebted to the Plaintiff in the sum of N1,239,501.00 (One million, two hundred and thirty-nine thousand, five hundred and one naira only) as interest rate has been wrongly calculated at the rate of 15% per month from 1st January, 1994.\\n2. Paragraph 4 of the affidavit of Samuel Ekanem is not true. The 1st defendant no longer owns Peugeot 505 Saloon Car Registration No. LA 1000R, Volkswagen Jetta Saloon car Registration No. LA 556R and Volkswagen Jetta Saloon Car Registration No. 557R as the same have been mortgaged to Guaranty Trust Bank Ltd since 20th January, 1992 as security for loan taken from Guaranty Trust Bank Ltd. Attached herewith and marked Exhibit \"A\" is a copy of the Chattel Mortgage.\\n3. The loan with interest which the 1st defendant took from Guaranty Trust Bank Limited has since matured and the 1st defendant has been unable to repay the same as a result of which Guaranty Trust Bank Limited has exercised its right over the aforesaid cars mortgaged to it.\\n4. Contrary to Paragraph 5 of the affidavit of Mr. Samuel Ekanem, the cars\\n\\n14\\n aforementioned are no longer the assets of the 1st defendant but that of Guaranty Trust Bank Limited. \\n5. I depose to this affidavit in good faith.\"\\n \\n It is to be observed here that the Plaintiff/appellant did not file any counter-affidavit to the affidavit in support of the application. I can therefore say that for the purpose of the intervener\\'s motion, the undisputed facts as summarized by the lower Court at page 58 of the record of proceedings were these:\\n\"In summary, the facts in the intervener\\'s affidavits are the following: On the 23/1/92, the intervener granted the 1st defendant a loan of N500.000 and as security for its repayment the 1st defendant mortgaged to the intervener. Its vehicles a copy of the Deed of Chattel mortgage and the intervener\\'s offer letter were attached as Exhibits A and B respectively to the affidavit.\\nThe 1st defendant did not perform when the loan became payable. The intervener seized one of the mortgaged cars namely Volkswagen Jetta Saloon car with Registration No. LA 556R in accordance with Clause 7 of Exhibit A. Strenuous efforts by the intervener to get the remaining two mortgaged cars were\\n\\n15\\n unsuccessful as the cars whereabout were not located.\\n\\nOn October, 11, 1994, the officials of the Court accompanied by armed Policemen and officer of the Plaintiff came to the intervener\\'s premises at 6 Adeyemi Alakya Street, Victoria Island, Lagos and forcefully took away the Volkswagen Saloon Car with registration No. LA 556R. The intervener claims that the three vehicles presently in the custody of the Court by the Court\\'s order belong to the intervener by virtue of the agreement of 23/1/92. It is deposed on behalf of the intervener that the said intervener had exercised its power under the mortgage long before the mareva injunction. A copy of counter-affidavit sworn to by the 2nd defendant and marked Ex. C was exhibited to confirm the fact that the intervener had exercised its power under the mortgage.\"\\n\\nThe Plaintiff/appellant has not challenged the above facts as found by the lower Court. I shall now approach the rights of the parties in this appeal from the background of the facts before the lower Court. I think that it was not necessary for the intervener/respondent to show upon his application that the deed of chattel mortgage executed\\n\\n16\\nin its favour by the defendants was registered. All that the intervener needed to show was that he was the mortgagee to whom the defendants had transferred the ownership of the vehicles. This was sufficient for the purpose of the intervener\\'s application. It is to be borne in mind that there is no standard of proof that is absolute. Proof of a fact in any proceedings is always a relative matter. The same proof found sufficient in a case where the opponent has not called evidence may be found in-sufficient where the adversary has called evidence.\\n\\nIn this case the Plaintiff did not challenge the intervener\\'s depositions on oath to the effect that the vehicles had been mortgaged to it. The deed of mortgage ex facie appears regular and valid. It was not open to the lower Court to speculate as to any impropriety or invalidity concerning the deed of mortgage when there was nothing whatsoever to put it on any enquiry.\\n\\nSection 197(1) of CAMA only makes an unregistered charge void as against a liquidator or creditor of a company. The Section however17\\n protects any contract or obligation secured by an unregistered charge such that a creditor under an unregistered charge can still recover his money. The plaintiff in this case was not in the position of a liquidator of the 1st defendant company. Neither was the plaintiff a creditor within the meaning of Section 197(1).\\n The plaintiff who did not show that he was a secured creditor could not by simply contending that the chattel mortgage in plaintiff\\'s favour was not registered place himself on a higher position on the scale of priorities than the intervener. \\n I think that the plaintiff in the way he argued overlooked the essential purpose Section 197(1) was enacted to serve. It seems to me that the essential purpose of Section 197(1) is three-fold. (1) To prevent fraud so that an insolvent company may not collusively dispose of his assets by creating spurious charges in order to defeat legitimate creditors (2) To enable the would be creditors ascertain in advance the state of solvency of a Company before deciding whether or not to extend credit to it (3) To ensure that a scale of priorities is readily ascertainable so that creditors of an insolvent18\\n company in liquidation may be paid from the assets in accordance with their position on the scale.\\n The Plaintiff would need also to show how non - registration of the Chattel Mortgage had injured it such that it be avoided as against It. The Plaintiff who was not a secured creditor could not have argued that the non-registration of the Chattel mortgage in favour of the intervener/respondent affected it. In Re Jackson and Bassford Ltd (1906) 2 Ch 467, 476 and Esberger &amp; Son Ltd v Capital and Counties Bank (1913) 2 Ch 366, 374, it was stated that the purpose of the legislation requiring Registration of Charges created by a Company is to enable those who deal with limited companies to search the register to find whether the company has encumbered its property or not. The Plaintiff who did not as much as secure its credit to the defendants could not therefore rely on Section 197(1) of C.A.M.A.\\n \\n In any case, there was the affidavit of the 2nd defendant which showed that as at the time the ex-parte order of mareva injunction was obtained, the title in the cars had passed to the intervener/respondent. \\n\\n19\\nThe purpose of a mareva injunction is to restrain a defendant against whom a suit is pending from removing or dissipating any of his assets within jurisdiction which may be utilised to satisfy any judgment that may be pronounced against him. In essence therefore a mareva injunction is anticipancy in nature. It seeks to ensure that any judgment which the Court may give against a defendant (the anticipated judgment debtor) can be satisfied from his assets.\\nIt follows therefore that where it is shown that a particular property does not belong to the anticipated judgment debtor (i.e the defendant), it is not permissible to keep in force any mareva injunction against such property.\\n \\nIn the final conclusion, this appeal lacks merit. It is dismissed with N4,000.00 costs to the respondents. \\n \\n PIUS OLAYIWOLA ADEREMI, J.C.A.: I have before now read the leading judgment just read by my learned brother, Oguntade J.C.A. I am in full agreement with his reasoning and conclusions. I have nothing to add. I adopt the said judgment as mine while I dismiss the appeal as being devoid of any merit. I also abide by the\\n\\n20\\n order of cost as contained in the said leading judgment.\\n\\nAMIRU SANUSI, J.C.A.: I had the opportunity of reading in draft form the judgment of my learned brother Oguntade JCA. I agree with the reasons and conclusion reached therein. I abide by the consequential orders made including that on cost.\\n\\n\\n21'"
